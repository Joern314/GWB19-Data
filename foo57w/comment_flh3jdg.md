The undulation of a ribbon, the crackling of lightning, and the flowing of magma around the world-skull all contributed to the formation of the Rhythmic One. These divine movements emanated across the firmament and reverberated around each other, inspiring the creation of 99 limbs centered on an axis.

"I am Yashqal!  I am what I dance."
