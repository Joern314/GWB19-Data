#The Foundations are laid     

With a new idea in mind, Lyva slithered over to the gigantic skull that [Malaphet had ejected](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgba32/) and into the eye socket. The object was enormous, yes, but size meant little to divinity. Everything was a matter of perspective, and as a mundane thing, the skull was barely more than a big hollow rock.     

It just needed to matter more, with more matter. And so she opened her mouth and summoned up a fragment of the wealth she kept inside her, vast troves of gold, silver, iron and countless other metals that she had hoarded in her pocket dimension and created more. Immediately an eruption of molten metal spilled from her draconic maw, and began to spill and gather through the skull, finding itself over and over, hotter and hotter, more and more, closer and tighter and denser.

Somehow it took more than she expected. Perhaps it was travel sickness, rejection of her traversing universes, but the drake goddess felt considerably poorer and lighter by the time the skull was full, yet also better. The metal was clear for all to see now. The vast rock shell of the skull now had a molten core of dense metal, slightly uneven, but once someone got it rotating and orbitting then gravity should smooth everything out. The others could probably figure things out from here, she decided, and hunkered down to nap in the molten core.    

[So, here is the core of the planet, I don't think it takes terraforming costs until we're dealing with mountains and continents and stuff, so if you've an idea for a primordial creation, throw it on here.]
