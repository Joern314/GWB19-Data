Azrakal watched the god descend on the land and start to form it.  
He was also shaping some creatures, they looked similar to Azrakal and the stranger.

Azrakal descended as well down to the land, he took his dagger, cut himself on his finger and the blood poured out.  
It mixed with the creatures the stranger was molding and it flowed in to them. Filling them with life.  
The beings breathed deep of the air.

The blood however poured away from the woods and where it went, it left red grass.  
A great red plains with very few and rare trees with red leaves.  
The fruit there was very sweet and juicy, and the trees dripped with red sap.
