[ uh. i am not sure how to explain the role playing. you just describe what your god does, usually as a 'third person narrator'. in the first turns people try to get to know each other's characters, talking about random things and fooling around. ]

[ on the Discord right now people are talking out-of-character about who needs to meet whom and how make a planet etc. ]

[ I also recommend https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ for a list of all new comments on r/godhoodwb . upvoting is the easiest way to mark comments you have already read through, you probably don't need to read everything. ]

[ Concerning the threads-and-answers: You can respond to people in comments, so that it is clear whom you are referring too. so if you want to meet someone, just respond to one of their comments, entering the situation. or start a new thread describing how you look for them etc. ]

[ you can tag people /u/joern314 if you do something that involves their god ]
