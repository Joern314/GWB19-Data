With an angry hiss, a ring of light appeared, a spiral pattern forming in its interior, turning faster and faster until only a disk of twirling blue could be seen.

For a moment nothing happened, but then a forked tongue entered this reality, followed by the head of a snake.

The gargantuan creature blinked, irritated as some stray debris flew into her eyes. She hissed angrily and pulled the rest of her long body through her portal.

Smoothly she glided into an orbit around the sun, until her head and tail were almost touching. The snake had finally reached a stable position, very slowly rotating around the warming source of heat and light.

She hissed again, significantly less annoyed.
