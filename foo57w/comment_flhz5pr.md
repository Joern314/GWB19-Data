 

New Metaphysic: Fidelity

Everything has a core essence. This essence can be perceived by the outward characteristics of the thing. Creatures can change their own core essence by dancing in a way that mimics the core essence of a thing. This is called showing fidelity. By showing fidelity to a thing one adopts a thingâ€™s outward characteristics to a limited degree. 

For example, a mortal looking to become tougher may show fidelity to a boulder. From observing the boulder they invent a boulder dance that captures the essence of boulders. Then the mortal practices this boulder dance for years; his skin grows tough and he is able to withstand strikes with greater resistance. In the same way, a fox dance may make someone stealthier, the gazelle dance may make someone more beautiful, the fruit dance may make someone more fertile.
