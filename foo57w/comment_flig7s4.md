"Plans, plans... I didn't make too many before attempting ascension... kinda difficult to do when it involves plunging a divinely created blade into your chest... I didn't even tell Lyva I was going to... odds of the ritual completing were probably 56% success, 24% immediate death, and 20% extreme pain. Waking up here was not an expected outcome..." Gon admitted.

"So for the most part my plans are to enjoy myself and help Lyva. Other than that, I am thinking I will go around dishing out vengeance for others. Gods, demi-gods, mortals; anyone who cannot achieve it themselves or do not wish to. I consider that part of enjoying myself." Laughed Gon.

"How about you? Planning to unleash storms upon the world for... uh... some reason?"
