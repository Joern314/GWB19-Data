##The arrival  of a father and son 

Blasts of red lightning spreading like a spider web and the sounds of booming thunder seemed to be the herald that  yet another divine had arrived in this world 

From within the web of lightning a void corridor opened and the first to step out was not its created but a teenage godling  with rainbow hair and a black cloak 


“Wow! looks like you actually got us to a world with gods this time.... Fifth times the charm isn’t it.” Prismari said then looked down at his ruined cloak and sighed 


Kain smirked as he looked around the new world unsure what was new and what was old  “ come on now young one give me some credit, I was able to allow us to travel and I change that nasty freedom sphere of yours into something more useful! “ kain said laying on his back floating with the help of his lightning  


“So like you can leave now can’t you ? I don’t need you tied to me like some demigod.” Prismari said as he used godsight and noticed a metaphysical tether attached too the both of them 


“ the thing is..... I can’t... your stuck with me, on the bright side.... I’m a little better at running’s civilization then you are.” Kain said with a smile 


“ didn’t you say your mother did most of the work ? For that.... if Prismari recalls right anyway.” Prismari said grinning and sticking his tongue out at kain 

This argumentative conversation went on for quite some time as the two began searching the world for other signs of life divine or otherwise
