Sunda laughed, a deep rumbling noise, as he beheld the spectacle. He charged forward through what little space he had before jumping. His form twisted and compressed as he moved, and in the space of a single second the chimera was replaced by a small mouse.

A small mouse that easily fit through the gaps in Lyva's cage.

Once outside Sunda changed again, allowing his form to swell up larger and larger, turning himself into a massive serpent that fell upon Lyva, fangs bared.
