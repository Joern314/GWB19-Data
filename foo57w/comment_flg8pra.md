####Lyva's Arrival

A golden ribbon slithered through the emptiness before creation. Lengthy and serpentine, the being's hide and scales were metal itself, broken intermittently by hatches and jagged cracks like maws, and four small limbs held close to the dragons body as if they were but an afterthought. And they almost were- there was no need for legs here, there was nothing to climb nor grab nor take, and she hadn't sensed anything worth anything in...

The creature paused, bright eyes flicking around as if searching for a star or moon, something to mark the passage of time and her travels. There was none. She didn't honestly know how long she had travelled to reach this universe, if it could be called that. It was an empty nothing. Yet it didn't feel like the universe she had left. There was noone here who knew her, noone who knew how amazing she was, and that just made her feel hungry. SHE WANTED **THINGS**!

With a frustrated roar, the personification of Greed cut off her trajectory. What was the point in travelling farther if she would just stumble across more and more emptiness!? No, the being expanded her awareness. If she wanted things, then this would do as good a place as any. After all, she was here now, and therefore everything would be hers. It only made sense. 

"**If anyone can hear this,**" Lyva proclaimed metaphysically in case any lazy divines were lurking in this void, a surprisingly excited feminine voice, "**This is MINE.**"

That made clear, she began to move and stir the emptiness, leaving metaphysical ripples through the primordial universe.
