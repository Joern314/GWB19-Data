"I am Gon Gryn of Earth and Vengeance. It is a pleasure to meet you."

"Hexes and contracts, hrrm? That's interesting, are you a native of this world?" asked after bowing slightly.

"Oh, and if you are likewise interested in getting revenge for some wrong, I would be delighted to help. It is sort of my... profession. I can not, however, currently turn on the goddess named Lyva. She and I are in a contract of sorts. I am sure you understand."
