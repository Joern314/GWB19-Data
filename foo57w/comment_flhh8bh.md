Azrakal was watching the big... blob above.  
The skull that born him was close to that... thing. And now it is the earth.

He wonder what kind of secrets that thing could be hiding, secrets have *power* most of the time.  
Only one thing to do. So he floated up toward the thing and stared in to it's eye.  
naturally, he could not see much. It was a giant eye.  
Well... maybe... if one could taste it's blood?

Azrakal pulled out The Blood Dagger once again, using it as a point, he punched and struck the giant eye.
