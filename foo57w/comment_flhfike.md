Azrakal watched the humans move around, some trying the fruits in the forest, others points and touch the red grass at it's edge.

Azrakal wanted to know these creatures, he wanted to know all their *power*.

So he descended down to them, he was like a giant compared to them, even the tallest of them only reached a bit above his waist.

"I greet you people.  
I am part of your creation, that which flows strongly in your veins, hiding beneath your skin."

Some of the people was confused, as none of them had bleed before.  
Azrakal counted this by slamming one of their heads between his hands, crushing it completely.

Naturally, everyone freaked out as the red blood flowed from the missing head.  
Then they really freaked out when Azrakal lifed up the man and drank his blood.

After Azrakal had finished his drink, he shouted.  
"That is not all! I bring you a horrible death! If the blood is not offered to me by crushing your head! I will have the dead walk again! And they will be horror behind your imagining!  
Be my blood offerings or face eternal terror!"

Azrakal took out The Blood Dagger and jumped quickly between people, killing a few individuals with a cut to the heart.  
These few dead started to rise as unliving

"Behold these creations of mine!"
