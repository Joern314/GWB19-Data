Rictus arrived in a new world. It looked like a clean slate. An empty reality. Maybe this was the chance to build something free from the taint of old evils he had been looking for and had been lacking so sorely since his ascension.

The planet he saw coming into existence before him was more of a core of molten slag. So to make some actual land he poured some divine power on top of the steaming and churning ball of molten fire. It coalesced into the first makings of a new continent. Land to be settled. On top, he planted a Forrest with many trees bearing fruit and many animals to hunt. Though he supposed he would need to show mortals how to do that once they were at that stage.

Then he began to form humans. He once had himself been a human. And this was maybe a good opportunity to experiment with human nature and maybe make them a little more nobly inclined than usual. Then maybe for once, he would not have to resort to the Iron Law.

He was about half finished with making the first humans when he decided to take a nap and finish them later.

[-4 for a continent piece]

[-4 for forrest]

[-3 for half of humans]

[/u/Rhaegar1994 you can tack on your bit, /u/Plintstorm you too and you can also come in spoil humanity]
