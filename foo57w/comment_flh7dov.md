Gon was dressed in simple sleeveless white robes tied around the waist with a blue cloth belt and a second belt that held a rough old scabbard. The blade's hilt shined a reflective gold, even in the gloom of a world without a sun. The white scars covering his body and the one over his left eye also seemed bright in the gloom. 

He was tall and the feathers on his head formed something like a crest that added to his height. Most were green at the base and faded gradually down their length to a purple. Three much longer feathers were colored reverse of these with one in the middle front of his feather-line and one over each of his pointed ears.

"Oh, your a new goddess? My... "Father" was originally a mortal, but he seemed to manage alright... after some adjusting. Doubtless you're more competent than he was, so I bet you'll have the hang of things in no time." Gon laughed.

"Goddess of protection, huh? With chains... well I guess that means you won't be wanting revenge on someone for imprisoning you. So what do you desire in this world?"
