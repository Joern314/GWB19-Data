# Purposes [Necromancy]

The use of necromancy serves three primary purposes: the acquisition of knowledge, the conjuration of illusions and the manipulation of the will of the living.

- Knowledge: The dead can trade knowledge after death or share knowledge they possessed in life. However after a year and a day in the Rift their minds start to forget and the knowledge they can provide dwindles. (3 acts for spells + 2 for secret)

- Illusion:   Depending on if the necromancer wants to show people good or bad events in an illusion, a soul is summoned either from the Sleeping City or the Endless Woods. The blessed souls from Oneiros, the Sleeping City can show others the dreams dreamt by the dead, resulting in an enjoyable illusion. Damned souls from the Endless Woods share their nightmares and horrors with people. (3 acts for spells + 2 for secret)

- Manipulation of Will: A necromancer can not outright mind control a person. However by summoning the ghosts of the Rift a sort of post-hypnotic suggestion can be laid on people, by ghosts whispering into people's ears and minds ideas, feelings or courses of action of the necromancer's will. (3 acts for spells + 2 for secret)
