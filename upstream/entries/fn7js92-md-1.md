Zara for a five year old... mostly thanks to her father had surprisingly good reflexes and only got hit with a few rocks thanks to it. She began thinking maybe daddy training wasn’t so bad 

She eventually caught up with gnawy tag him yelled “your it “ and began running away again. This time a tad faster then before
