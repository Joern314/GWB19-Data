**Description:** Vampires are people who have received the great gift, including immortality, great power, regeneration etc. etc.  
Vampires are no longer mortals and live forever until killed, and have some useful abilities, such as sensing blood near them.  
Vampires feeds on blood, even if they no longer die of thirst or hunger, they will still feel it, hence a vampire can go mad if not feeding for long enough.  
Current way of killing a vampire is complete disintegration of their bodies, leaving but a tiny part behind will allow them to fully regenerate.

All vampires belongs to a bloodline, giving them even more abilities.
