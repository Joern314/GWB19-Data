The city of Wooxti-Kwashotl is named for the respective human and yashool tribal confederations that it is comprised of. It is located in the jungle of Primus, along the Bakwagalis river. Seasonal flooding turns the streets into canals. Buildings are built on mounds to prevent flood damage. Dancing is central to all public ceremonies in the city. All major societies of dance are represented: Whisker, Sting, Black Wing. During the Age of Cities its major industries were bronze working and bumblebird jelly harvesting. During this age the city had much contact with Thool's Crater and Raha'stal.
