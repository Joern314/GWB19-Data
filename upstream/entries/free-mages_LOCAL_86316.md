By training their minds in special way the people known as Free Mages have special capabilities, by giving them enhanced mastery over their memories.

What this means is, if they see or experience a specific move set, like a fighting style, carpentry or free climbing they can replicate these moves from memory. As memories are imperfect and often colored by the individuals that have them, this process is not perfect. Only allowing for weaker versions of whatever they copy from their memories. It doesn't make them masters at any particular skill they replicate, but allows them to be skilled at many things.

This even extends to magic. They can summon magic spells they remember at will into the real world. Thereby replicating said magic. As stated above memories of mortals aren't perfect, so the magic produced is often times less powerful than its original version. And the more complex the magic the more unlikely it is a free mage will be able to replicate it to a more than mediocore success.

Since Free Mages only copy the memorized effect of a spell, their castings don't share the same limitations as those of the original magic like set metaphysics or rituals required. The caster is limited only by the number of spells he has witnessed and thereby at his command and his own endurance.

The demigod Ferus teaches new free mages, who can pass on the knowledge of how to become a free mage to an apprentice.
