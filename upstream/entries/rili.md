**Sphere**: Balance

**Description**:
An offshoot of the Vengeance sphere, Rili is in charge of bringing balance to the world, something that seems to be an impossible task. She fell under Gon's influence thanks to the close relationship that their spheres have. It is said that she is the one who holds the scales level whenever things are weighed. Opposes Gon overreacting or dealing out unequal vengeance.

She appears as a white feathered gryn dressed in white and wearing a black blindfold. She carries a set of scales at all times. Often stands perfectly straight on one leg and always walks like she is on a balance beam; one foot directly in front of the other. Similar to a very cautious bird.
