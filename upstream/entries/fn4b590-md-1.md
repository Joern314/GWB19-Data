"I have created magic to forge a personality of my choice. You made the tools to tailor mortal flesh into a shape of your choosing. My magic and your metaphysical law do this by taking pieces of the dead and giving it a new shape and new life. I wish to pair a tailor-made mortal body, with a tailor-made personality to produce as close to a perfect mortal as possible. A physical body at the peak of mortal performance with the personality to strife to improve on this outer perfection and the inner personality." The Sorcerer explained. "Making the ultimate mortal from the parts of the dead is the perfect way to honor what the dead left behind in the world in my opinion."
