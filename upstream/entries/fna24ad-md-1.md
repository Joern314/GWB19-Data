Gon smiled softly and stroked Yana's feathers as well as the child held to him.

"Are not all wants your needs, my lovely Greed?" Gon joked, then laughed as Yana poked him in the belly.

"My form's a mess... can't get my arm back to this form, can't stop myself from being little different than a feral beast in a full form shift... Seems like the explosion is what knocked some sense back into me last time I was in that form, but... hrrm..." Gon replied and set Yana down on Lyva's lap with a grin.

"You haven't seen daddy's tail before, have you little one?" Gon said as he hopped up and took off the belt that usually held the Retaliator. "I think I can manage that."

Gon's feathers went up as he focused, and he stood on the front part of his talons. With a growl and a grimace, his feet started to shift to more reptilian, with a few cracks and pops the change spread up his legs until finally with a more feral growl a tail erupted from his form, purple and green feathers extended along it's length on the topside until they reached the tip where a cluster covered the tail, adding some length to its appearance.

The now half lizard Gon exhaled, stumbled forward a bit, and smoothed down the feathers on his head.

"That'ss still prretty hard to do... Here, daddy's tail." He laughed as he turned sideways in front of the pair and swung the tip towards them. His tail wasn't as flexible as Lyva's or the child's so standing sideways was the only way to bring the tip to them. It wagged slightly in front of Yana, brushing the child and Lyva with its feathers.

"Can't control the thing fully yet... sorry." He chuckled as he watched the tip move, apparently not on purpose.
