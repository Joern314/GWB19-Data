Prismari did his best to help lyva through her pregnancy when ask. well also taking care of Zara. He truly didn’t mind the increased kleptomaniac tendencies and even offered to his blood form time to time. Thought he didn’t really understand why 

Zara on the other hand was completely and utterly thrilled to be having a little baby sibling! As she lay on lyva underbelly at awe of lyva dragon form and giant size.

“Immmmm so exited lyva mommy !!!! What are you call my little brother or sister.... can I teach them how to splode things.” She said as she approached the top of lyva head and then suddenly Took off trying her best to run from head to tail until she finally calmed down from all the excitement
