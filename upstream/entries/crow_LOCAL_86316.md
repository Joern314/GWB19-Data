The Crow is an artifact, that looks like a child even to gods. It was made to serve as protector and play companion and caretaker for Yana, the daughter of Lyva. 

Crow in its normal state is like a very dim-witted young child in intellect and appearance. But if Yana is threatened the monster inside comes out. 

Inside Crow is an old rusty metal scarecrow with eyes of fire who will attack anything with malicious intent towards Yana. It has iron teeth and claws and is supernaturally fast, strong and can blend in with the surroundings, if not directly looked at.

The Crow is also fireproof.
