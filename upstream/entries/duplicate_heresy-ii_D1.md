# Heresy II [None]

The tribes of the hunting grounds have heard many different tales of the apocalypse. Through telling and retelling and the compilation of different stories the most widespread theory on the end of the world emerged and was passed on.

A wave of fire and ice will deplete the worlds forests and game. Then a foreign race of red skinned mortals will wash over the land consuming what is left. Sentient construction filled with the voices of the dead will scatter the mortals that are left. Horned beasts will emerge to trample the earth until it is completely barren. And then snakes of iron and giant spider webs will spread over the earth until it is drowned in rivers of stone.

The only thing the humans of the hunting grounds see differently is the time it will take for the world to end. They think the time is measured in aeons instead of years.
