# The Geyser Erupts [None]

Rictus hearing tales of the wild beasts of the west, decided to travel there himself. Seeing the need to give the people hunters that could defend them, he taught the people of the west his miracle to produce Waidm√§nner, the world's best hunters and how to use magical arrows to slay the dire beasts from afar. In fact he participated himself in the hunt.
