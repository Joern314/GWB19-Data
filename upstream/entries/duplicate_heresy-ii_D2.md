# Heresy II [None]

In Redgash, the Vengeful said their struggle was to end, they would break though Amalah and take it's place as it's rightful rulers.  
The Vengeful would have their home back.  

Great blood would be spilled, the sky itself would rain blood from the red god himself. And the Black Lady would embrace her people.

Only after this, would the world be allowed to end.
