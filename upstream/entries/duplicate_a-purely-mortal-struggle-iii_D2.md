# A Purely Mortal Struggle III [None]

Raldric had been fighting most of his entire life, he had even returned to the blood plains after fighting in two wars.

There, he spread his knowledge that fighting on foot could be done with great strength. Some of his ideas did start to catch on, but he was old, very old and one day, he fell asleep and never woke up. Sure, his body did but he did not.

Raldric woke up in Oneiros, the Sleeping City, there, he continued his training and to fight, he was a master at both mounted combat and fighting on foot and he saw no reason to stop.
