# The city of Raha’stal [Nations]

Over the years as the beast slayer Rahab strength and night grew so to did the village of the prismatic plains

Soon rahab had a grand ambitions. He envisioned at the base of the mountain path leading to the pilgrimage of heroes... a grand city that could one day house every hero in existence... and he would lay it’s foundation 

Using the bone of the fallen fallen dire beast he had slain he created the first of many building what would one day in the future be called the hall of heroes.... but for now it was just rahab house. His people fallowed his lead and created there own house each with unique  architecture... no two looking the same. 
It was easy to tell those who where heroes with in the city for there house almost always included the bone of dire beast in there construction and so the city of Raha’stal was born 

Over the years as Raha’stal grew other tribes of the prismatic plains cane to join the every growing city of heroes,  attracted by it tails of mighty mortals who could grab ahold of possible and protect the ones the love 

That wasn’t the only reason the population of Raha’stal boomed no one of its hero residents in the first half of its Existence named Umah the green handed discovered a great way to feed the nation with the technique of Moderate Farming(-4 for moderate farming ) with a little helping hand of Prismari even if she didn’t know and was accredited with the creation. 

Mortals also stayed for the general sense of community, lead by what where  once the zepho tribe, yet it had become the zepho guild of heroes , whom welcomed  any and all into its ranks. So long as they could uphold the ideas that all must who join must help the weaker members of the ever growing city
