# A Purely Mortal Struggle III [None]

Udeis luck finally ran out and the Iron Judges and Waidm√§nner finally caught up to him. He was sentenced to a quick execution for the people killed in his shady dealings.

Being clever and willing to go to extremes had him kept ahead of the Iron Law for decades, but even that wasn't enough to run forever in the end. 

He was swiftly beheaded and the Rift Keepers collected his soul. Against the powers of the Iron Judges and death even the quick wit of Udeis had not been enough.

Cast into the Endless Woods and hunted for many decades by his own nightmares of rival gangs and thugs, he finally managed to use one of the Sorcerer's absences to sneak into the Sleeping City under the name of someone else. Someone's whose soul had and would never reach the Rift, as the person in question had been turned into a mortal hero.

And so he dreamed the endless dreams of heroic and a warrior's life of Yrdin the Iron Judge in the Sleeping City.
