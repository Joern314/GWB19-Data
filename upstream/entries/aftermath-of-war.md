# Aftermath of War [None]

It's been decades after the war at Amalah but now, something returned.

Some people went missing, some screams in the night was heard before they were cut down.  
Some bloody remains were found, and sometimes, even some unliving.

Maybe a killer is on the foot?

[/u/andrewjamesdrake, Amalah got vampires now hiding there  
Also, feel free to go crusading to crush the vengeful]
