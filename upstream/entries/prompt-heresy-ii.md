# Prompt: Heresy II [None]

Many among the Apokryph had gained scraps of necromantic knowledge and tried to travel the Rift or summon spirits of the dead. However in their botched attempts they either summoned Apokryphs, who had died in foreign realities aeons ago or messed up their memories while traveling between planes.

The result was a jumbled mess of information of the ends of many worlds. No two people could settle on one way the world would. Some cited meteors falling on the world, or a big shadow coming to devour or mate with the world, depending on who you asked. Others talked about giant mortal made moons in the sky firing with divine power or possessed by the divine themselves. Others talked about hellish dimensions revealing themselves or mutating sicknesses
