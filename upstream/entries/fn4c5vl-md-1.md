Glypha from within one of her pockets produced the stone. "Wouldn't dream about losing it!", she said with a smile. "But I thought in light of recent events a visit would be a better idea than summoning you away in your current condition. My visit serves two purposes. For one I want to offer my congratulations on your current circumstances. I am wishing you all the best in the production of your offspring.
