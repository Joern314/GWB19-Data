# Crisis: The Geyser Erupts [None]

The Sorcerer had granted the race of Apokryph blessings beyond those of many other mortals. Among them was longevity, but also innate magical talents to enable people to think faster and better if they were destined for the caste of philosophers, to fight longer and harder and be blessed with sharper senses if they were meant to be guardians, and to be more enduring, able to tolerate hard work better and improved dexterity and wit to perform the tasks of the citizens. Coupled with the mages inane talents for magic and the longer life spans the Apokryph of Secundus had the magic of the Sorcerer running through their veins and were able to use necromancy, necrurgy and the other runes of the Sorcerer to succesfully either keep out of the dire beasts way, or slay them with their magics and the talents of the most formidable of the dead translpanted onto the living. Even the Sorcerer himself in his Avatar participated in the guise of the Vir Sacra, the Sorcerer's prophet in the hunt for the dire beasts.
