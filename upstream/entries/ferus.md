# Ferus [Demigods]

[Turn 8](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fylavg/endless_pantheon_turn_8/fn70yyk/)

Once a mortal descendant of Rictus. He was turned into a demigod by Rictus and is his one constant companion. 

Ferus is the **demigod of memory** and bestows the miracle of memory on those he deems fit to be free mages. Who in turn can pass on this gift.
