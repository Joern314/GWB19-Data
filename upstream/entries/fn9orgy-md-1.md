Glypha perceiving the birth of the young dragonling through her own veil of secrecy she had spread over the child's existence. The child was young and could maybe use a protector and a companion to play with while growing up.

So Glypha had pondered ideas. She had only limited knowledge of children so thinking about who the child's parents were. 

So she collected scraps of metal and stone. Out of metal she made a rudimentary skeleton and covered it in sack linen. Lyva was the goddess of metal, so her child would maybe appreciate the link to the mother. The child itself was supposed to be a demigod of fire as Glypha new and so she lit a fire in the scarecrow's eyes. 

When some mortal children saw the partially rusty construct with fangs and claws of iron, they ran away screaming. Not the effect Glypha wanted to achieve. 

So as the father was a god of the earth Glypha covered the skeleton in the earth and molded it into the form of a child Then she took some extra skin she had laying around and covered the humanoid shape in the skin. That was better. 

At the core, if it was the scarecrow so Glypha called the thing Crow. Crow could serve as a playing companion for the child. being essentially a child itself. Glypha had used some of the sorcerer's magic to mold a rudimentary mind into the construct. It would be like a dim child. But if something tried to hurt the young offspring of lyva, the metal scarecrow underneath would come out to play.

With Crow in tow Glypha went to visit Lyva and Yana.

[-10 for artifact: Crow]

[-2 to make the insides a secret so it seems to be an ordinary child.]
