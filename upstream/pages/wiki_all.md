### Azrakal

**Appearance**: A flayed man with little cloths.  
Previously: A human male with black tattoos over almost his entire body. No hair and wears simple cloths that covers very little of him.  

**Spheres**: Blood and Power

**Plans and Style**: Desires blood, lot's of blood, so much blood. Will create short lived empires that goes out to capture people for blood sacrifices. Also create Vampires. Mostly being Evil.

**Origin**: Born from a divine drop of blood.

**Further explanation**:---

### The Forgotten

**Player**: /u/Abacadaren

**Spheres**: Lost things and Sentiments

**Appearance**: The Forgotten appear as a pile of discarded scrap and items, like a junkyard given life. Broken dolls, Old tools, Books with torn pages, all set in motion of one united goal: to have back what once meant so much to them.

As far as sound, The Forgotten are in a way able to speak, either through old and worn voice boxes and speakers, or the imitation of speech through the crunching and creaking of it's piles.

**Plans and Style**: The Forgotten intend to be remembered and to reduce the number of things that are lost. Their ultimate goal is, in a way, their own destruction and the removal of their furthered creation

**Origin**: Since the beginning of creation, creations have been set to the ways side. Things that once meant so much to someone can come to mean nothing in time. It's hard to remember exactly when you forgot, just that you forgot it. When The Forgotten tried to not be is anyone's guess.

**Further explanation**:

Lost things here in refers to second death style things, lost to the point no one else would be able to find/connect. This includes lost memories as well, to tie into Sentiment. The dead are a difficult case, so to set it as clear and best as possible I deal in lost things, not lost people. Spirits and souls can remember things and pass on their memories, but they do not count as remembering things themselves.

Sentiment refers to connection and emotion, like love or care (though it can be negative sentiments). The feelings one has towards a favorite stuffed animal, or the love for a family member.---

### Gon Gryn, Vengeance Reborn

**Player**: /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

**Spheres**: Earth and Vengeance

**Appearance**:
A tall and muscular half-bird, half-elven man - a race known as the Gryn - with earthy brown skin covered in bright white scars. The most noticeable of these is the scar over his left eye. In place of hair, he has a crest of feathers similar in appearance to a filled-in native american chief’s headdress. These feathers fade from a bright green to a vibrant purple, with three longer feathers fading from purple to green. Green eyes flecked with purple seem to be full of intensity and he usually wears an odd smirk. Below the knees his legs become those of an eagle and end in sharp black talons. Gon doesn’t seem particularly picky about what he wears, and can often be found wearing whatever clothes are provided to him by Lyva. He does slightly favor dressing in white, but for formal occasions he dresses in a green feather robe; a memento of his “father”. In battle, he wears traditional Arakyl feathermail over a purple padded tunic. The only thing he consistently has on his person is a particular sword known as The Retaliator with its plain dark leather sheath and belt.

**Plans and Style**:
Gon has only recently ascended into godhood and the shift from a demi-god to a full fledged divine being has left a mark on him. He intends to make the best of his new powers and rather simply enjoy himself. The fetters of fate, however, may not be so easy to sever.

Being the amnesiatic form of a god from another existence, Gon has a strange mix of apathy and curiosity about him. He has a knack for understanding magic and seeks it out with enthusiasm, but tends to laze around otherwise. Outwardly friendly, Gon only truly enjoys the company of those who have become consumed by some desire; he enjoys seeing them work tirelessly towards their goals. Especially if those goals include revenge.

**Origin**:
Gon was a semi-divine being created partially from the soul fragment of a god with the same name from the Fire Realm and the memories and personality of the phoenix god, Nekalos Toneyl. His former self was apparently destroyed along with Nek’s home realm, but the god attempted to achieve resurrection in a new plane of existence by placing a fragment of his soul in the banished phoenix god. Interference from the Serpent Goddess Celastra of Space, Secrets, and Shadows caused the plan to fail and Gon’s memories were stolen and placed into a demigoddess known as Lyva. Following the recreation of his body as a demigod, the amnesiatic Gon - known as Hunger - found himself somewhat enamored with the demigoddess and her greed. Seeking refuge from a dysfunctional family relationship with Nek and his demigoddess daughter, Hylatka, Hunger decided he would stay with Lyva. Once Lyva had achieved true divinity, Hunger agreed to travel away from the world with her to seek his own divinity elsewhere.

Divinity itself, however, has a price; as he traveled with Lyva, Gon was able to modify the so-called “Toneyl Divinity Manipulation Magic” developed by Hylatka and create a divine spark by siphoning the power of souls consumed by his blade into himself. Unfortunately, this seems to have had some side effects…---

### Lyva

**Player:** /u/Smcadam       

**Spheres:** Greed and Metal     
             
**Appearance**: Lyva’s usual form is an athletic metallic goddess with curling horns amidst her long hair, and a long tail. Various panels and scales on her can open like drawers and doors to a pocket dimension where she hoards and collects… well, anything that catches her attention.                        
She normally flaunts her wealth by wearing a vast diversity of jewellery and dresses. She can shapeshift, normally changing what metal she seems composed of, or turning into a metallic asian style dragon occasionally.      

**Origin**: Lyva was originally “born” in a divine accident, from another deities greed breaking off. She’s tempered a little bit by wisdom and cunning since her birth, but fundamentally just wants everything. She quickly acquired adoptive parents, friends and lovers, and used them to ascend to full godhood, before leaving to claim her own planet.---

### Oryllia, the Witch-Queen

**Player**: /u/DragoneyeCreations

**Spheres**: Hexes and Contracts

**Appearance**: Oryllia appears as a feminine figure made of violet fire, with metallic pieces adorning her like armor. Most notably, a plate with long curling horns covers her eyes like a blindfold. She wields a hammer, covered in runes.

**Plans and Style**: Oryllia, being a goddess of hexes and contracts, seeks to curse both the land and individuals through various means. She lures mortals in via contracts with her, which will nearly always end in the mortal being cursed. Primarily, she will be feared, and those who actively worship her will be those pushed to the fringes of society for being profane.

**Origins**: Oryllia was born out of the dregs of creation, the profanity, the sludge that soon became the pit from which all of her Hexes came from.

**Further Explanation**: Oryllia is an evil aligned god, so expect plenty of chaos to come from her. It’ll be a mix of simple tricks and horrendous evil.---

### The Sorcerer

/u/Gwydion-Drys

**Spheres:** Magic and Death

**Appearance:** The Sorcerer is humanoid in appearance. What distinguishes him from a normal human however is his grey skin, which is covered in tattoos and runic markings, retelling his life story to those who can interpret them.

He is normally clothed in splendorous traveling clothes and wears a hooded cloak. His eyes are representative of a dark night sky filled with stars.

**Plans and Style:** Magic, Death and the Afterlife are linked. Expect to see as much in-game.

**Origin:** The Sorcerer was once the prophet of a god of magic and darkness before he rose to the rank of a demigod and finally ascended to full godhood. In the absence of his once patron deity, he himself took over the leadership of his people. And now he wanders the multiverse in search of a new world that could make an apt permanent home for his people, after their erstwhile world suffered catastrophe after catastrophe.

**Further Explanation:** The Sorcerer was once an idealistic youth trying to follow in his patron's footsteps to be a force of good. Repeated betrayals by his closest allies have made him pragmatic and weary and have shifted his focus from looking out for everyone to looking out for his people.---

### Sunda

/u/StarOfTheSouth

**Appearance:** Sunda is a chimera. The back half of a goat, the front half and head of a lion. His tail is a serpent, on his back he bares the wings of a bat (appropriately sized), and small horns curl back over his head.

**Spheres:** Animals and Wilds

**Plans and Style:** I mostly plan on mutating and combining animals, taking what we already have and twisting it into something new.

**Origin:** One of Lyva's scales broke loose, combined with the last remnants of that Act Feyrun threw through the sun, and turned into Sunda.

**Further Explanation:** Not really sure what needs to be elaborated on, as I'm mostly just planning on doing character stuff this game. No big plans from me.---

## Minor Gods

### Dogu

**Player**: /u/Abacadaren

**Created**: [Turn 2}(https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flswxji/)

**Sphere**: Tidiness

**Description**: An old Clay doll with faded pigmentation, Dogu was the first lost thing within the new world. She took it upon herself to help the other lostlings, and reminds those who care about their things to take care and maintain them.---

### Kzivo

**Player**: /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

**Created**: [Turn 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flnbeso/)

**Sphere**: Caves

**Description**: 
Kzivo appears as a large limestone man with stalactites coming off his arms and replacing what would otherwise be hair. The whole thing gives him a melted look. He carries around a large and strange pickaxe.

His exact origins are unknown; Gon Gryn awoke one day to find him simply working on expanding the caves in the shattered mountains. It is his job. Apparently he is the brother of Olasea, Minor Goddess of Erosion.---

### Olasea

**Player**: /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

**Created**: [Turn 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flpo5p4/)

**Sphere**: Erosion

**Description**: 
Olasea appears as a very energetic young girl made of perfectly smooth granite wearing what looks like rages but are actually extremely smooth pieces of slate.

She can most often be found on mountain tops, sanding away rough edges, breaking apart stones with a hammer, and causing rock slides. After trying to break Gon Gryn in their first encounter she began considering him the "big boss" who provides her with all of her work. Apparently she is the sister of Kzivo, Minor God of Caves.---

### Rhelii the Reaper/"Miss Fortune"

**Creator**: Oryllia ( /u/DragoneyeCreations )

**Created**: [Turn 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flng3vh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**Sphere**: Misfortune

**Appearance**: Rhelii appears as an amber-skinned giantess with long braided and dreaded hair, colored black.

She is responsible for sewing the misfortunes of mortals within the flora of the garden.---

### Cosmogony I

[In the distant future...]

The Shaman moved closer to the fire, beckoning both children and adults to sit down and to listen to the tales and myths of their ancestors. He coughed once, put down his walking stick, and stretched and shook his arms and legs in preparation.

Then the tribesmen grew silent, and the shaman began to dance and speak, enacting the very origin of the world they were all living in...

***

In the beginning, there was the void. And from the void came the first darkness, and with it came Sarah. And as the void vanished, Yashqal began to dance.
But around the void there also was the profane, from which the Witch Oryllia rose, cursing the safe darkness with nightmarish screams.

A third god had been hidden in the void, and to spot him you only need to look into the sky. The countless eyes of Malaphet watch every moment from above, but his words cannot be comprehended, so strange and weird is his mind. The sun is the biggest of his eyes, swollen with an angry red dot where Azrakal once stabbed it. And the stone everyone walks on, it is the bone of a giant skull, which Malaphet had spit out from one of his many mouths.

It is thanks to Lyva that the mortals need not live on its inside, for she filled it with her most precious possessions, sacrificing more wealth than any mortal could ever dream to have.

After the ground was formed, Kain released the air, and the Salty Knave rode the ocean that appeared in a giant flood.

Rictus then brought the first land, and he began to form the first humans, more noble than any other creature. But their bodies were without blood, and only when Azrakal gave them his own, did they awake and walk around.

Yet, immediately afterwards, he demanded they return the gift, he tried to take back the very essence the humans need to live! If not for the protector, Sarah, this would have been the end of them.

Azrakal is an evil god, and up to that moment he already had offended many of the other divine as well. Some say he even brought the Unliving as a twisted curse, others say that the Undying were beyond his powers.

Either way, that moment his offenses could no longer be tolerated. The Sorcerer brought back to life those whom Azrakal had slain, and taught them how to get to the Rift after their death. The other gods subdued Azrakal and tore off his skin, putting it on the world as an additional layer of dirt and stone.

This was not the only time the gods were fighting, there were plenty times when the world was at danger due to their violence. Malaphet once almost squeezed it into two halves, leaving a gaping trench behind. And the rumbling mountains spew fire even in this day, created by Sunda who fought with his mother Lyva.

There also were peaceful scenes of cooperation, like when Thool crafted the moon from a tooth of Malaphet, or when Gon Gryn, Prismari and Sunda gathered stones for the second continent, or when Shilo won against the other spirits of grain, or when Prismari began the legends of heroes. There even was a comet, who brought the Essence of Life and gave our world a spin, such that the sun would reach all the lands equally.

Countless more stories are there, of the children of the gods, and their grandchildren, the smaller gods like the Recorder, and the bigger ones like the Gargantuan Snake.

But those are for another time...

***

The shaman's speech and dance ended.

Casually he tried to play over his exhaustion, leaning against the cave walls.

After a moment of silence, somebody asked: "What happened to the gods? Why aren't they around us right now?" The shaman coughed once and said: "They... have to rest, needed a break from creation." He smiled. "Just like I need a break right now. Is the cooking finally done?"---

### The Blood Dagger

**Creator**: Azrakal (/u/Plintstorm ) 

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgrobm/)

**Description**: A dagger forged with the scales of Lyva and the Blood of Azrakal. The Dagger absorbs blood, including that inside the people it stab.---

### The Retaliator

**Creator**: ??? ( /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW ) 

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flg98lz/)

**Description**: 
A feather shaped blade that has turned to pitch black obsidian after being used in a ritual to ascend to godhood. A fuller ran the length of the blade and formed what would have been the stem of the feather. The shining brass or gold guard was formed in the shape of wings, the handle wrapped in a what had become rough blackened leather in a criss-cross fasion, and the pommel was in the shape of a bird's head with three eyes. Each eye was a different gemstone; emerald, ruby, and diamond.

The Retaliator was sword of divine creation that Gon brought along with him from another world. Having lost its old patron and having being used as a catalyst to create Gon's spark of divinity, it was been rendered powerless and immaterial.

**Blessings**: 0 (The blade exists as a part of Gon's divine form only, for now.)---

### Fidelity

**Creator**: Yashqal(/u/hpllamacrft)

**Created**: [Turn 1]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flhz5pr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**Description**: The true essence of all things, which can be mimicked to induce transformation. 

Every thing has a core essence. This essence can be perceived by the outward characteristics of a thing. Creatures can change their own core essence by dancing in a way that mimics the core essence of another thing. This is called showing fidelity. By showing fidelity to a thing one adopts a thing’s outward characteristics to a limited degree.
For example, a mortal looking to become tougher may show fidelity to a boulder. From observing the boulder they invent a boulder dance that captures the essence of boulders. Then the mortal practices this boulder dance for years; his skin grows tough and he is able to withstand strikes with greater resistance. In the same way, a fox dance may make someone stealthier, the gazelle dance may make someone more beautiful, the fruit dance may make someone more fertile.---

### The Thirteen Hexes

**Creator**: Oryllia(/u/DragoneyeCreations)

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flhf0w8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**Description**: A set of thirteen distinct blights upon the world, forged by the primordial dregs of creation.

#### Hex 1 - The Soil Shrieks

Every time a region of the world is covered in darkness, the air is filled with bloodcurdling screams.---

### Tsukumogami, or Familial Bonding

**Creator**: /u/Abacadaren

**Created**: [Turn 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flte821/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=GodhoodWB&utm_content=t1_flsx2v4)

**Description**: Items gain power based off the time that it spends with its owner who gives special care and attention to it (Whether positive or negative). Items can be passed on to family members which regress the years to halfway through the previous phase (Excluding the final phase). For all intents and purposes aside from worship, items that have bonded to the 100+ years phase are mortals.

Years Owned | Power
:--|:--:
1-32| Easier/Harder maintenance, can make small jumps/jerks of motion, Aware of who owns it
33-66| Finer control of self, can provide the feeling of an emotion to its owner, able to "see" up to 5 ft away (Blindsight 5 ft), and weak special abilities based off of what the item is (Mirror can control its reflection, cooking knife can auto-chop ingredients as long as its held, stuffed animals can make animal noises)
67-99| Can do multiple actions in a row, Can provide concepts/ideas to owner, Blindsight 10 ft, special abilities are strengthened
100+| Full control of self like any person would have control over their body, Sentient personality based off of experience and owner(s), able to communicate with those around it, Blindsight 20 ft, Can be passed on to family or friends without any regression of power. Item never losses its sentience or ability unless destroyed

Of note, hero artifacts are spawned from a soul and as such aren't fully inanimate objects to be affected by this metaphysics, but things like artifacts can be---
