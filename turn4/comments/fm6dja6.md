As if on queue space began to shake with an angry roar as Malaphet's full presence arrived, he had noticed the intruding gods some time ago but only just realized that two of the three were gods that were present were those who had worked to deny him his meal before he had had to take his nap. After that he had been gradually inching his presence closer, normally he would have been spotted long before but the gods seemed to be in some emotional distress.

After opening with the roar and a psychic scream of rage he wasted no time on pressing his advantage, firing a beam at the trespassing deity, specifically the one that seemed to have been on the loosing end of the confrontation.

After his opening Salvo he plunged forward from all directions having succeeded in enveloping the intruders, jaws agape as they readied to tear into the enemies divine flesh, giving the other offender minimal attention while the tentacles purposefully moved to avoid the final goddess, he remembered that one from the first moments of divine activity in this universe.

In the distance Lyva could barely see a entity of rock struggling to push the moon back into it's correct orbit as it was jostled by Malaphet's assault.
