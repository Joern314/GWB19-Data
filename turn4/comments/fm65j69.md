Prismari poor little mind was overloaded at the idea he could have a parent... the only prenatal figures he ever had beside Celastra was the two he created for himself.... 

He could barely stand the idea 

“**NOOO THAT WOULD MEAN PRISMARI WAS LEFT ALONE TO FEND FOR HIMSELF.... WHAT TYPE OF PARENT WOULD DO THAT** ! “ Prismari said in frustration anger and sadness 


“ I suppose the best place would be to start at the beginning.” Kain then explain to Prismari and lyva his own heritage, he was from a line of gods whom where know for there sadistic nature... who’s most prominent member tried to eat and become one with the world 

He explained how he left his homeworld  behind at the age of sixteen where he went on to meet Prismari mother a water and combat goddess named Uzu, with whom he  had two other children with, Prismari older siblings  Uxil  Korin. 

“And that brings me to the tragedy of the night... well I was traveling to my original world to share the joy of my newest child there was a disruption in the void.... the child lost its form... and was swallowed by the void.... I refused to believe they where dead... and so I dove in to the unknown and began my search. 

I finally caught up to you in what you both consider your home world... but it was just as you where preparing to leave... instead of interfering I let you both go and spoke with a nice little beetle.... who was a little to proper for my liking. 

After I picked up your trail.... I find the boy. And the rest is the history of this world.” Kain explained his story 


In his core Prismari may of slightly believed the words of kain but in his mind it was just sadness  “I don’t believe you !!! Why should I  “ Prismari sunk his head in to lyva shoulders it seemed he wasn’t taking the news well at all.

Kain looked to lyva “ do you believe... I have no reason to lie .”
