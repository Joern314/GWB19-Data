"No, you're going to thank me for my present!" Lyva snarled and span, ducking as the blades cut into her metal flesh and tail. She had to dart back as current raced through her form, grimaced and suddenly cracked her tail off the floor and ripped her tail off, throwing it at him like a man sized grenade. 

"Ha!- What Tondr-" She gasped, before two explosions went off at the cliff base. The Tail chunk blasted into flaming debris, while Lyva herself was immersed in white energy and violet flames, her form igniting rapidly at the spark.   

As it ended, she was barely standing, blazing in violet flames though her metal skin was cracked, twisted and ruptured, her chest and back hatches hanging open, and she fell to her knees, looking to see if Prismari was standing or not.
