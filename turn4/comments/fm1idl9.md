"Kain's still her- AAH!" Lyva suddenly burst into violet flames at his touch, jumped back and hovered in the air, sparks and fire lashing off of her almost like Oryllia, "Sorry! Sorry, this substance is bad with water, let me just..."     

With a final spark of flames, a wave of black swept over her, and Prismari recognised the sleek dark metal of Computite as it drank in the flames, and Lyva flopped back down to the ground, an apologetic smile on her face. "There. Now, come here and talk!"    

She grabbed him up and coiled around him in a hug that squished the colourful blob, metal warm but no longer burning. "I don't think you owe Kain. He helped you, but he didn't save you- you could have found your own way here. You've done harder things. If anything, leeching off you so closely for millenia, he owes you much much more!"     

She leaned back slightly and gave a quiet smile, "I doubt he's evil, but I don't believe in much evil. Everyone has different values. Truth and Secrets. Riches and Freedom. Control and Identity. The only evil I believe in is wasteful self destructive behaviour. That's just toxic, but Kain doesn't strike me as like that. 

"But he does owe you, either answers or cut off to find his own way, or proper demigod servitude. Don't be too soft with him," The metal goddess purred as she squeezed the slime blob close.
