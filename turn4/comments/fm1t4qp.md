###The Holy Kiln Isles   

The Gelbrous tribe largely lived within crude nests and hits in the upper branches of the Echoing Jungle. The Apokryphes had fallen far from their proud ancient roots, and even those Lyva considered rather savage. So she decided it was time to enlighten them properly.        

For that matter, why not get these savages away from using stones and onto proper materials? She probably wouldn't accidentally kill them all. Probably.    

One night, as darkness circled the globe, the stars of the Serpent constellation seemed to come alive and glide over the sky, revealing a vast golden serpent who looked down upon the world. 

"Little ones. Mortals. You are meant to be more than this. You were born to walk across this world and live like queens. You need greater tools, farther horizons. My name is Lyva, Goddess of Greed and Metal. Unbreakable, Eternal, and Insatiable." She began, and taught them as the night wore on, her voice almost drowning out the usual screaming hex that came with night. 

She taught them how to work wood better, to build small rafts and greater fires. She taught them how to build better shells and huts to store their wares and protect themselves. She taught them of iron sand and lead and other metals, and how to smelt bronze.     

"These are rare, but they shall outlast you once forged, treasures for your daughters and their daughters. Yet I have cast one place upon the world of my making where they are not rare, where metals grow like trees. Seek the great smoking isle, look to the north, and my chosen ones shall forge great works in my name there, in the Kilns."      

Once the mortals had been taught her message over the night, Lyva recoiled and rested, feeling herself wearied from speaking so gently to so many. Even as a demigod mortals had felt fragile to her, aging and withering so quickly, but now she had to whisper slowly and precisely to even speak with them!     

Even so the message worked, and at her words, the Gelbrous tribe amongst several others began to search for the smoking island, and unlike the others they spied the island from the shores of their jungle home. Over months they prepared small coracles and basic rafts and ventured to explore the mushroom covered landscape, finding it bountiful and filled with great spikes of iron, bronze, copper and many other metals. Within a few years, a good chunk of the Gelbrous Tribe and some neighbours moved to the Kiln Isles, taking up the work of forging spearheads, axeheads and other goods with which they could threaten or trade with their neighbours.    

The volcanic mountain at the centre of the Kiln Isles became regarded as holy soon, and more than once a zealous follower of Lyva ventured up to try and climb down into what became known as the Serpents Maw, and found themselves incinerated by the heat within. 
Lyva kept them and remade them nonetheless, touched by their faith, and wove them into new minor gods to serve at her whim.
