Gon, having been consolidating the power of any earth related minor gods under him one day noticed that there seemed to be one made of clay, but not of relation to the land or his sphere.  Curious about its origins, the feather-headed god stalked after it, until he found himself in a plane surrounded by curious objects, seemingly from everywhere. There was a strange feeling. As he bent to examine one that he had bumped by with his talons, he called out.

"G'bolla? Hello? Is there someone here? Who's plane is this?"
