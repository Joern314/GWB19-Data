In the jungles of Primus, there were two large tribal confederations: the Wooxti, a tribe of humans and the Kwashotl, a tribe of yashool. They lived in the fertile lands between the mountains and the river Bakwagalis. They were people of dance, and they roamed the jungles showing fidelity to the titan bearcats, avocados, and bumblebirds. 

The humans hunted fanged deer by spear, gathering their exploded flesh and cooking it over campfires. They lived in mud-huts with roofs of large broad leaves. Clans of the Wooxti rarely exceeded 500, when there was usually cause for a man of middling ambition to take up with his relatives and establish his own riverside colony. 

The yashool lived somewhat differently. When they sleep, their root systems burrow into the soil, nourishing them with precious nitrogen. They spend their days finding sources of water and the perfect places to photosynthesize, which in the depths of the jungle can mean climbing to towering heights. The yashool, living up to 200 years, were more cooperative than the humans, and Kwashotl clans were usually much larger, reaching thousands of yashool. 

Now that the undead were self-detonating due to an internal fungus, the Society of the Sting, human and yashool alike, no longer had to consume the bodies of their tribe-mates. They were relieved but also disillusioned with what they had dedicated their lives to. The Wooxti and Kwashotl, differing in their daily lives, grew apart, and forgot one another. 

Yashqal feared they would lose their way, and forget the dance of the Scorpion, so he spoke to the wisest of each tribe and led them to a small island in the middle of the Bakwagalis. This island, though small, was plentiful in all the resources both peoples needed. The Wooxti and Kwashotl decided to establish on this island the Scorpion Council, made up of 5 humans and 5 yashool. This council trained masters of music, dance, and the Scorpion martial art. Mortals from the forests to the south, and even the odd Apokryph, traveled to learn these ways. This would be an island dedicated to preserving the traditions of the Society of the Sting, as long as the council sat on the island they could uphold their traditions and be sure of their preservation.
