The small explosion throw the blob Prismari off  it balance and then the purple flames claws came at him... he wasn’t quick enough to change slime to skin and so the split second lyva’s flaming claws touched him there was another slight explosion yet this time it was Prismari 

When the smoke cleared he had skin once again but a portion of his chest was missing and colourful slime could be seen crawling it’s way over to him 

“That hurt !! “ Prismari said with a laugh and the blades of water lost there cold constant drip instead replaced by a uniformed electric energy across all ten blades 

Prismari then once again sent them toward lyva as he shot in to the air trying to avoid her the best he could... it’s not like he could take many more fiery claw attacks 

“I’m not losing too you... Celastra always use to win and I’m going to this time !!” Prismari voice boomed as lightning began descending from  the sky 

“ **LOOK OUT MISS  LYVA** “” tondra could be heard in the distance
