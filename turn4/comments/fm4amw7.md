“Is he to scared of me now to ask me himself.... regardless. What would you trade a way little miss... for the information that only  I hold.” Kain said with a grin if this goddess truly had any feeling for his son he hope she would off him something even a pebble

“ I WANT ANSWERS.” Prismari said with a yell 

“Then let’s see what you little friend has to offer .” Kain said with a sad smile. Thinking maybe he should just leave... but Uzu would kill him if he didn’t atleast try and bring Prismari back with him
