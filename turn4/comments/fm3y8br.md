The holy mountain of heroes 

The zepho tribe always held the mountain of primeval man in high esteem. Over the year  the people of the zepho tribe have had a few conflicting legends. 


One was that it depicted the first human hero whoâ€™s knife is held by the head of the tribe 

Others say Prismari created the mountain to hold the souls of heroes, so he could one day use them to wake the mountain to be the world greatest hero 

A third less popular legend was that it was created to hold a great unknown evil in the sky at bay 

No matter the legend the people agreed the mountain was special and must be of great importance to ever and all heroes... and so they would partake in pilgrimages to the mountain site

It became habit along the way to help fellow travels or small settlements with the current problem, such as clearing out wild beast or even just fetching water for the elderly. It was clear  to make the pilgrimage one would need to  having a strong sense of community a willingness to help other even if it meant nothing but a thanks or warm meal in return 

At the mountain base many would leave small gifts or trinkets they discovered on the way to Prismari. And then most would depart a select few stayed behind becoming the mountains task masters or sorts, each out choose a spot along the way to the mountain and help direct pilgrims toward those who need help 

[ the holy land the mountain of primeval man Influences is measured by the amount of every day heros who help the communities along the pilgrimage]
