#The Men of Dernas
[Recovery: The Holy Land]    
[Also: Probably a few Past-Turn Prompts I've hit as a drive-by]

The Caldera of the Crowned Mountain is the Holy Land of Mair.

The God of Life emerged from the Well at some point in the Mythic Age, and they called out across the world to Humans who had a fire in their heart. Mair summoned men to the Amalah, to face the challenges of the rough land... and claim the bounty at its heart: The Essence of Life.

The Men of Amalah fought their first war against Nature itself. The Beasts of Amalah are larger, stronger, and tougher than those of other lands. Even the Trees and the Plants are mightier than those that grow beyond the foothills of the mountainous lands. In spite of the overwhelming force of Nature, the determination and cunning of Man allowed them to secure the land of Amalah as their own. More importantly... they claimed the Silroin Caldera and the Well of Life at its center.

There they met their God, who bestowed upon them a gift beyond all others: The Essence of Life that flowed up from The Well. Mair taught the people to draw the Essence forth from the Vortex without being caught and dissolved in its flow, and the God of Life showed them how they could make use of it. Drinking the Essence would allow men to heal their wounds supernaturally fast, although even the Essence could not restore lost limbs or reverse a killing-blow. Feeding the Essence to their crops would grant unnatural fertility to the soil, and give men a bountiful harvest.

Mair also delivered a warning to the Men who had won its favor. Mair had blessed them with the opportunity for prosperity, but that blessing was also a curse. They would grow to be a great people, wealthy and numerous. Their lands would be filled with monuments and masterworks. Their granaries would overflow, and their tables would rarely want for meat. They would be a prosperous people... and that would win them the envy of others. Other Men would look upon Amalah, the land hard-won from Nature, and they would grow to desire it... and the Well at its heart.

Mair foretold that many wars would be fought over Amalah, and the Well at its heart; and that the Men who claimed mastery of Amalah would have to fight against those who sought to usurp their mastery. The Men of Amalah took this to heart. The finest Hunters among them became the first Warriors of Mair, the Guardians of the Well. They learned to fight against, and to kill, *men* by fighting among themselves upon the Shores of the Well. They dealt crippling injuries to one-another, barely pulling their blows... and then recovered by the Power of the Life Essence. They became strong... and soon they became the Defenders of Amalah.

A great Kingdom rose up in the Age of Myth, centered in the Silroin Caldera. The Well's Blessings allowed the People to grow in power *rapidly*. Its blessing of Fertility upon their fields caused their Crops to be bountiful, and so men were freed from the struggle for survival and allowed to focus on other things. They built the Great Temple of Life around the Well, and a Great City around that. Their Dominion stretched to the very foothills of the mountains. Their borders were protected by Warriors who had come within inches of death time and time again, and had grown stronger and more skilled from the experience.

Of course... things fell apart in time, as the God of War had foretold.

The Downfall of the Kingdom did not come from beyond Amalah... it came when the Kingdom was fractured. None remember how it happened... but those living outside the Caldera turned upon those who lived in the Great City at its heart. This Civil War was as long as it was violent. The Well's Protectors were turned upon each-other, and the Cities of Amalah were ground to dust by their struggles. Even the Temple of Life itself was reduced to ruin by the battles. The Knowledge and Wealth of the Kingdom was destroyed in the War... and its people were left scattered. Even the Kingdom's Name was lost. Nature reclaimed the Land... for the Men were too weak to hold it.

Now that Mair's Influence has returned to the world, dreams of restoring the Holy Land have begun to enter the minds of the People. Already, they have begun to raise a new Temple around the Well of Life. It is a simple Stone Circle, a mere shadow of the Great Stone Temple that once stood there... but it serves as an important symbol. The new Temple of Life is a promise to Mair, a promise that the Kingdom and its Warriors will rise again.

These Men have given their new realm a name, one that invokes what has been lost. They call themselves and their city Dernas, The Kingdom.
