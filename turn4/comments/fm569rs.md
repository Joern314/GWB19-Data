###The Empty Temple - Part 2

The Empty Temple is situated on a hill near Sanctuary. Its internal structures are comprised of megaliths, which serve as the bones of the structure. The backroom serves as a small workshop where primitive statues of the gods are hewn from flint and limestone.

At the entrance figures maybe depicting the Sorcerer and Rictus can be found, but due to the age of the statues and the crudeity of the fabrication it is hard to tell.

Inside the main room two pits serve as sacrifice pits to burn offerings to the god in. 

As it is meant to serve as a home to the gods many furs, seats and primitive tables can be found within the side rooms as well as sleeping and fire places. There are no walls per se, but with wooden struts and sticks connected to the megaliths a framework for walls is formed. The "walls" themselves consist of furs, dried foliage and wicker.

The "walls" are painted in primitive colors, mostly depicting mythological scenarios, like the creation of humans and Apokryph, the laying of Azrakal, Rak being dragged to death by the Sorcerer or the first Iron Judge sentencing Ras, the blood emperor.
