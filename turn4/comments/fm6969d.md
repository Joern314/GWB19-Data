Kain took lyva words to heart... he was always a procrastinator... but maybe he also had a thing about running away... first home then to chase a lost child... she had a point and it hurt him deeply... he then though of uzu and the children and hope they where ok tears formed in his eye 

“ please don’t rip off my legs... they take a while to grow back. Unlike my arms.” Kain said with what sounded like he had experienced it before 

“You are right I made a horrible mistake.... I didn’t know how to tell him....I’m sorry for the lost time ...I’m not here to take him... I just wanted to spend time with him... and then wanted him to decide.... I figured he would know upon meeting me.” Kain said it seemed his mind as well was getting a little frazzled 

Prismari stayed silent and slowly picked up kain by the neck 

“Lyva... can things get out of your hatch ? “ Prismari asked with out smiling 


“Do what you must.” Kain accepted 


“ I’m not hurting you.... I need time away from you..... so lyva can things escape.” Prismari asked a tear rolling down his face. It seemed he processed the news finally and decided he wanted kain and him to spend some time apart
