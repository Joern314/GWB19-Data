# Dire Beasts in the Great Forest [None]

[/u/rhaegar1994, I've decided to give the God of Heroes something to have Heroes fight.]

A Shard of the Comet had broken off from the whole, and settled into an unstable orbit. It was composed of a shard of Crystallized Life Essence. After a long wait... it finally fell into the Planet's atmosphere and fell to the ground. This tiny meteorite of solid Life Essence was *shattered* by the stress of reentry... and thus a shower of Crystallized Life Essence fell upon the Great Forest.

Each Animal that found a shard of the Crystal *mutated* rapidly. They grew *larger*. Their teeth, claws, and *antlers* grew sharper. Their bodies grew stronger, faster, and tougher than was natural.

In short... there was a small outbreak of Dire Beasts in the Great Forest.
