Having encountered no other mortals, the Nkarlen of the Sodemon tribe spread far and wide across the rolling grasslands. Their main concern remained the Beardillos of the God Sunda, and many took to praying to him in the possibly vain hope that they could somehow learn to use the beasts for their own purposes.

Exposed to the sunlight for long periods, these goblins' skins slowly turned a bright green, giving them almost natural camouflage among the green grass. The Sodemon tribe slowly started to take on a savage nature as if they were influenced by the ferocity of the beardillos, and even sometimes attacked other goblins from either Nkan'gbamo or Nkloig Sekzil who ventured out in exploration.

Gon watched all this with no small amount of amusement. Competition among them would make the tribes stronger was his opinion and those who died in the scuffles were acceptable losses. Yet something about the situation still bothered him; an odd feeling about seeing his creations wonder far from their home. Something familiar.

Uneasy at such a sensation, Gon took to the high mountains crafted from their peaks a method for which the wayward Nkarlen might one day find their homeland.

So appeared in the sky the constellation Segil'reld, the Great Bird. Seven bright stars, all with a green and purple hue marked the beak, wing tips, two legs, the end of the tail feathers, and one at the heart of the being, were filled in with duller stars to complete the image. All glistened like bright jewels in the heavens and the beak of the great bird was anchored above  the Temple-Caves of Nkan'gbamo. It would be said that the bird always flew home.
