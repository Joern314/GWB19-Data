Dreams of Divinity: In the Underworld

*"It is... still active." A woman's voice whispered quietly.*

*"How can this be? After all we have done..." A proud male voice responded.*

*Gon leaned forward on the round table marked with concentric circles. In the center, a golden rune wriggled and blazed. The faces of those around him were blurry. A cold hand settled on his shoulder.* 

*"Is something the matter, Gon?" A cool, flowing and gentle woman's voice whispered in his ear.*

"I have seen this before."

"Seen what before, feathered one? Lord Gon? It is I Jikzek. Met, we have. Other thing you see?" 

As Gon opened his eyes the aged Jikzek inquired curiously as the hall full of goblins watched in reverence as he knelt before the stone chair. Gon glanced to his left hand where another rune glowed, though not the same as the one from the dream. He must have nodded off. The Goblins had reached the depths Nkan'gbamo after years of learning its passages.

"It is nothing, ahem, just some divine business. What were you asking?"

"My lord, Jikzek has grown old. Must ask what child should carry on my name. Blessed with twelve I was. How choose?"

Gon smiled and sat up straight in his chair still wearing the emerald tunic Lyva had forced onto him. He waved his hand.

"Bring them before me."

Jikzek brought them to stand before the - to their eyes at least - empty throne. Gon looked over the collection of shoddy creatures as the light of captured Hoarding crabs danced on the walls from their pins that functioned like lamps in the temple-caves. 

"To select a new one..." Gon started, making sure Jikzek was paying attention. "... you will have them travel to the Mouth of Creation from which all goblins come from. We need to bring that tribe, the Enkenea into the fold of my dominion once more. Do this and spread my name around those lands. Bring them into the embrace of the earth. No longer shall they live above ground. The first of to return to this throne shall be my new prophet.'

"Feathered one..." Jikzek started to protest, but Gon held up a finger to stop him.

"I suppose you are wondering how they shall dig there homes deep into the hard ground, yes? Well, I have a gift for you and my people. Come."

Jikzek approached the throne hesitantly and kneeled before Gon who set his hand onto his head. Jikzek's mind flooded with knowledge as Gon gifted him all of the knowledge of mining.

"Teach this to your children and my priests... you have done good work, Jikzek. This is but the beginnings of my knowledge of how to shape the earth to your desires. Go forth and spread this knowledge. Dig deep, seek treasures. Gems and shiny metal, let those other mortals that steal them from you know my vengeance. Now go! There is much to attend to, but should you require me, you have but to pray."

So it was that Jikzek passed this information on to the Nkarlen tribe of Nkan'gbamo, the Mogimal, and a pilgrimage to the mouth of creation began. The tribe there, the Enkenea, one of the two surface tribes was awed by this new knowledge and began digging their homes into the surrounding hills and founded the priesthood of Gon known as the Ranos. Slowly this site grew into the most important section of the goblin lands. While it would always pale in comparison to the glittering-temple caves of the controlling Mogimal tribe, this site became the Goblin's and therefore Gon's Holy Land. It is said that those who live there must live underground.

By the time of Jikzek's death, all of the Nkarlen of the Holy land had converted to living underground and his forth son, who took up the name Jikzek as well, was the first to return to the Stone Throne in Nkan'gbamo, becoming the next prophet of Gon.

\[Holy Land Prompt - The Mouth of Creation - Influence is measured by how much of the population live underground.\]

\[Priesthood of Gon founded: The Ranos.\]

\[The first goblin prophet, Jikzek, dies. He is replaced by Jikzek (the Second)...\] 

\[Three tribes of Goblins now exist; the Mogimal of Nkan'gbamo are in the most control, the Enkenea of Nkloig Sekzil are now digging holes and becoming very religious, and the Sodemon are out in the grasslands turning green and getting mauled by Beardillos...\]
