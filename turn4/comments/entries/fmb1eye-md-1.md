Varador the mountain crosses 

The old tree pedalling his wears would come acorsss a strangely dressed human, one who wore the colourful furs of animals 

He was sleeping beneath a tree and looked as if he had seen better days. He awoke to the calls of the old tree... when he seen a tree speaking and pulling a curt, this caused  him to  rubbed his eyes and assumed he had passed on 

“ hey tree.... am I dead ?” Varador asked with serious concern, he was the only survivor of an expedition to the green land of legend and the people of the prismatic plains already believed him  long dead
