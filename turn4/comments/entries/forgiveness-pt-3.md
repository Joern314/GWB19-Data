&#x200B;

In the still of the night, while the great Shagantar Arslan slept, Thool approached him in his dreams. "Oh mighty Shagantar, arise and meet your god" Arslan woke with a jolt to see a young man standing over his bedside. "Who are?! How did you get in here?!" He screamed. "I told you, I am Thool. I am your god, and you will be my prophet. I have failed to protect your people for thousands of  years, yet without me you have managed. I am here to apologize and ask for the forgiveness of your people". Thool bowed deeply before the Shagantar. "I have answered the prayers of your people to live out the rest of their days in a home that I have created" Thool said somberly.

The large tree seemed awestruck. Here before him was one of his creator gods, and the god bowed to him. "My lords, it is not you that should be apologizing to us, but us apologizing for losing our faith". Arslan dropped to his knees with his head bowed low in an act of patronage to Thool. "I am but your humble servant my lords. It would be an honor to be your prophet. Guide me to the promised land so that I may lead my people, and we will worship you for the rest of our days" Arslan declared.

"I have already marked the way for you so that you may guide your people to the place that I have created for you". Thool held up his harvest sickle. "Follow the markings on the trees that I have made with my sickle. As my prophet, only you will be able to see them with my blessing so those that wish to do you harm are not able to locate this place" Thool assured his new prophet. "When you have reached the promise land, you must navigate the caverns. The Kazish will guide you to the basin where you will be able to create a permanent settlement. This shall be the home of the Shagan.
