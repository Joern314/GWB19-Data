# None [None]
Prismari smiled a true smile as lyva yelled at him and brought up all the god times... parents or not he was who he was. And he loved who he loved... on the other hand he never expect to see this sand and he made a laugh 

“ you.... you kept some.” He said kissing her tears still rolling down his face

“ Lyva... you say all the things I have done for you... but you and your mother have done more for me then any one... you have given me a home and family.... one that is better then anything that would be father would have to offer.... and I promise you now like I have before.... I will never leave not with out you. Are souls are bound more then kain and I are by are spheres and he will never take me away from you.” He said and kissed her again 


“ maybe we should go to the real world... I forgot it wasn’t as big as Celastra storage.... “ he said with a teasing smile. He wasn’t feeling fully better but lyva had comforted him greatly
