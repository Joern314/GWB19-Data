# None [None]


Varador checked for a heart beat... it was beating he must be delirious a talking tree.... if he ever made it home the others would not believe this 

“ I’m varador the crosser if the mountains.... and you are a yashool? And you really are real” he said pulling a mari flower and taking a bite giving him a jolt of adrenaline... but it didn’t cause the talking tree to disappear 

“ I’ll trade you the rest of this magic flower for some of your jelly... or if you wish I can take you across the mountains to my home land and we could attempt to set a trade route.” Varador said with a greedy smile he would be hailed as a hero if he developed the first line of connection to the outside world
