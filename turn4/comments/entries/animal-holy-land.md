# Animal Holy Land [None]

A number of tribes, human and Yashool, came together to form something great. They had heard the Word of Sunda, the Wild Lord, and decided to preserve his work.

At the base of the mountains that bordered the Great Forest they set created a land that would allow all animals to roam free.

For as long as this land stood, they promised, they would safeguard all the wild things that needed protection.

Sunda-Tor, the Wild Shield, was born that day.

\[founded a Holy Land, with the purpose of protecting the wild within it. Like an animal reserve. It's in the Great Forest, near that mountain range on the western edge.\]
