“It is great to see you again my wriggling friend” Thool said elated. I have heard the needs of our people, it seems that the moon I had placed was not as helpful as I thought it would be. Perhaps they need some additional help?” Thool asked. 

“Yeah, I mean the moon was good and all for counting the months, but the cycle of ten moons is just a little bit shorter than one rotation of the world-skull around the sun. Our people are counting the moons and losing track of the passing of the seasons! We have to put something in the sky to mark them. Maybe we can call on our friend Malaphet to aid us.”

“Hmm I see your point” Thool said pondering the problem at hand. I suppose I overestimated our people’s knowledge. You would think with a lifespan of nearly two centuries, they would have figured out that the change in seasons can be predicted” Thool said. “Nonetheless, if they need an indicator then we ought to give them one”. 

Yashqal looked to the deep darkness of the sky, the eldritch expanse of Malaphet and asked, “Oh primordial one, place for us a star in the heavens: let it be green in the spring, turquoise in the summer, orange in autumn, blue in the winter.”
