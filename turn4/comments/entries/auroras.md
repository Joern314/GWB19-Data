# The Auroras [None]

Auroras began to dance in the Night's Sky across the planet, turning night into a strange day lit by flowing colors.

The Men of Dernas began to see a parallel between the Auroras and The Well of Life... and they began to work on means to draw *meaning* from the Auroras. They found that the lights often heralded battle, illuminating villages before Raiders or Predators could do their work. They did not come *every time*, nor did their coming guarantee battle... but the Aurora was accurate more often than not by their reckoning.

[The Aurora does nothing to actually predict battle.]
