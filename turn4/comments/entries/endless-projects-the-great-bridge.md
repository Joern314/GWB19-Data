# Endless Projects: The Great Bridge [None]

As time went on, the Zepho Tribe found that much of the Gelbrous Tribe had moved to protect and guard the Holy Kiln Islands where they forged spears, tools and other items of valuable bronze. However they could only truly travel by small raft and in tiny groups between the islands and mainland, and both sides agreed that they must improve in order to trade farther and show themselves to be above the other savage tribes.    

For this reason, a bridge has planned across the narrowest points of the straits between the archipelago of the Kiln Islands, and the mainland of the Echoing Jungle. The bridge would be a gigantic symbol of mortal progress by both humans and apokryphes, a symbol of unity, and allow better trade and access to the islands.
