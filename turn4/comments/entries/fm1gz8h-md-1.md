The tribe of Trelim

The tribe of trelim are worshipers of kain who broke off form the Zepho tribe a nearly two hundred year ago. They stayed nomadic fallowing storms and praising kain as the giver of rain, that was until three generations ago when the settled with in the vast Echoing jungle north of the great forest 

 On the anniversary of the settlement day  that they honoured kain coincided with kains chat with rictus and kain now  in a bad mood released a massive storm upon the jungle that caused the tribe to faces the worse catastrophe they could the death of the chief family all for save the tenth son by his third wife  (-1 hurricane flavoured smite ) 

This left the tribe in a weird position they needed to find away to appease the anger storm god and so the turned to the other tirbe the inhabited the echoing jungle the gelbrous a visit
