"My current evaluation is that your are untrustworthy. If you are untrustworthy, your contracts are untrustworthy. If contracts are untrustworthy, they are worthless. *Without Value*. Currently the sphere of Contracts looks far closer to being dregs than Hexes do." Lyva shifted abruptly, her metal skin changing to a new configuration, a new rougher grey texture, her horns jagged antlers, her tail sharp and twisted, emanating a toxic heat.      

"Of what value then is a deal I cannot trust? Even if kept, your sphere is Hexes, plural, and I deem it highly unlikely that that refers to only two. I see no part of this deal that would prevent you from reinstating the Hex immediately, or a worse curse in its place, without technically reneging on your actions. Your current terms are a dead end deal, but an opportunity for you to prove yourself to be someone worth dealing with rather than to be absolutely mistrusted as the antithesis of her own spheres."     

"Therefore, I'd urge you to reconsider your *just this once*, in order to enable reconnections and growth of trust for the future." Lyva stepped forward and gently look her hand, the contact with the toxic metal intensely painful, and placed a broken goat-like horn in it, "Now, I have you given you something, satisfying my end of the bargain, and in return you will lift the curse upon Darkness."    

"Or we can stop dealing with technicalities and try dealing with each other in actual faith before I bring my collection to the table."
