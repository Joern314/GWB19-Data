# None [None]
Prismari gambit didn’t pay off and as of yet he was unsure if it would but as lyva knee reached his gut he lost his breath for a moment 

“ the sword... well .... my dear.... it’s for this.” Prismari said as he caught his breath and once again used his storm sphere to back away as he held the sword in the air 

“Split “ prismari said and his crystal blade split. In to ten crystal fragments floating on the air as if controlled by Prismari and the winds  (-2 the splitting blade of the hero god ) 

Lyva was soon under assault by the floating blades five of which seemed to carry an electric like current and the other five coated in what looked to be water. 

yet  lyva could tell the temperature oh the blades with water where sub zero as if there where covered in water meant to be freezing rain .... Prismari smiled at lyva 

“ just because I can’t use it up close doesn’t mean I can’t use it to keep my position” he said cheekily

[just to be clear the blade only splits and floats, the rest of the powers like the lightning and water are coming from Prismari not the artifact ]
