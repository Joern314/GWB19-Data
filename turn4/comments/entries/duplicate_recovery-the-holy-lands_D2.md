# Recovery: The Holy Lands [None]

*The Blood Shrine*

Sometime after the rise of the [Red Star](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fsee67/endless_pantheon_turn_4/fm45syc/), the prophet of the red god, the butcher god and the mighty rider constructed a simple shrine.

This shrine he explained, is to be feed blood.  
The blood is feed to the shrine by the butcher of the herds

And so it was, the shrine becoming a place to shed blood.
