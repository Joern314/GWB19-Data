Lyva listened with interest, rather impressed and inspired by the story of a god trying to absorb and subsume the world- there was some quality greed!

"I believe he's another stupid proud old god. If he's lying then he's an idiot for spinning us this, and if he's honest then I'm going to rip his legs off and see if he can replace those as easily as his ASYMMETRICAL ARMS!" Lyva roared, tail hammering furiously into the ground behind her.   

"You left your children and your lover for ten thousand years to try and chase down someone who's MINE!" She snarled, hugging Prismari protectively. "YOU ABANDONED YOUR FAMILY TO ROAM THE VOID! And even worse, even more insane,  you wasted four fifths of that time!"   

"There's sunk cost fallacy, but what nonsense stopped you revealing yourself before our slumber!? You could have had millenia awake with your family, you could have had hundreds of thousands of nights with your lover, so if you think I'm letting you take my boy then you're going back to the void! You'd just abandon him to chase another lost splash!"
