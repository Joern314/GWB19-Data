# The Holy Lands of the Stars [None]

Malaphet watched what had been his meal, mostly out of boredom these days, though he did keep an eye on the gods whom had halted his last meal, waiting for a sign that they had lost attentiveness so that he might try to sneak another meal, hopefully one unhindered this time. As he watched he noticed the call that emerged from a particular island that he had pulled up from the ocean floor prior to his nap. Nothing lived there, at least nothing mortal, not yet anyway, and yet he could feel the island itself calling to Malaphet. 

This was the largest of the islands within the Tadaloan Island Chains and also the one that he had left behind the majority of his essence. As he realized this he watched with greater interest, and as he did so he realized that the more he watched, the louder the call of the island became, but not only was it calling out to him, but it was resonating, feeding him, taking a bit of the edge off of his hunger.
