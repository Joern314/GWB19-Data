Lyva was in a pile of rubble, blinking stars out of her eyes.    
How had she gotten here?    
Some... Prismari had managed to use her own power against her. That was it. That wasn't right! She gasped and grunted as she stood up, looking up at the cliff she had been thrown into, her iron skin dented and bruises, the doors down her back dent notably inwards, not longer smooth and flush with her skin.   
That was fine, she wasn't going to show the enemy her back anyway- speaking of, where was he? Lyva blinked as she noticed a somewhat blob lying nearby and also reforming.   

"That's it buddy, you're in for it!" She growled, tensing once more as she changed form again, her dents still remaining as she turned to a lighter weaker grey metal with curling horns, charged forwards and grabbed at the wet sections of the shard sword. Instantly her potassium fists ignited and somewhat exploded, turning to claws of violet flame that she swung furiously at the blob.
