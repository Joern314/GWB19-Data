# Prompt: Endless Projects - The Wall (Part 1) [None]

The mortals took notice of this of course, because they couldn't exactly *ignore* the small earthquake that Glypha caused on her way out of the ravine.

The unliving horde was a bit noticeable as well.

So the mortals did what they could: they rallied, they fought back, and most importantly they made a large wall. Or at least, they tried.

They put in a valiant effort, with the stone construct being quite large at the time construction stopped, but there was one small problem with this undertaking.

The mortals of the time weren't exactly the best builders. It wasn't their fault, no mortal in the world had the knowledge to build something such as this. The entire thing fell into various states of ruin after a short period of time.
