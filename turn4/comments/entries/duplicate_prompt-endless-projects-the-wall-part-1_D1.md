# Prompt: Endless Projects - The Wall (Part 1) [None]

For millennia humans and even the stray Apokryph family had tossed their nearly dead or dying relatives into one ravine, no mortal could hope to climb out of without help or climbing gear more advanced than anything that was available in this day and age. Whenever an unloving finally died a burst of magic was released and so the magic seeped into the stone, along with the fear the mortals felt when tossed into the ravine, the hunger and suffering of the unliving they became and the rotting flesh of the corpses.

Over the millennia a holy land of the followers of Sunda formed near the ravine. But as on the surface a new budding nation was forming atop, in the ravine something stronger, mightier and altogether more fearsome formed. Glypha, the goddess of Fear and Flesh awoke with an earsplitting howl that could be heard across the whole continent.

Angry to be caught in the ravine with the unliving she shattered the walls of the ravine and leading a horde of the unliving to the surface she swore to teach mortals not to put people through such agony.
