# None [None]
As the Blood Riders travelled among the Plains in search of knowing the night sky, they reached the western edge of the plains, where a small group, called the Turmoiled, resided. This tribe made claims of a Witch who blighted their promised land, as they gestured towards the Wastes of Pain and its poisonous, rocky, and thorny landscape. However, the shamans among them claimed to know the true path of the night sky, thanks to their divination through the screams of the night. They offered the "Blood Riders" aid in their endeavor, in exchange for some of their mounts.
