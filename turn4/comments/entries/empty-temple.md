After the disappearance of the gods, the fall of the old empires and the end of the era of legend and myth some mortals were glad to be rid of the disturbance the gods represented to the world. Some people however missed the gods and the more colorful advanced world they represented. 

Among them were a group of Apokryph and humans, who wanted to convince their gods to return. And that marked the begin of the construction of the Empty Temple.

Meant to be a temple to the gods like many stories of old talk about, the Empty Temple started out as a hut. A luxurious hut, but a hut nontheless. For the mortals it would have been a splendid home, but to the gods it was not. 

Crude boulders, rocks, planks of wood, hides of animals, gems and whatever else the mortals could conceive of as building materials were used to enlargen, enrich and spruce up the empty temple. It was all in all a try to bribe the gods into returning. 

And even when the gods finally did return after millenia they still did not pay attention to the Empty Temple. For all it was it was still just a hut after all. And so the Apokryph and humans keep building and changing the Empty Temple, year after year, day after day, doomed to never be finished.
