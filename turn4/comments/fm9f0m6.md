[During Turn 5]     

Noticing that Prismari was still somewhat down about his father, Lyva considered what children tended to do to distance themselves from their parents, or progenitors. And so she decided to prepare him a fun make over, and flew around quietly, seeking out suitable hosts. She chose ten mortals, and vanished them from their lives, taking their souls but more importantly their forms.    

Then one day, years after the revelation of Kain, Lyva called out to Prismari in Godspeak and invited him to a cliff overlooking the great river in the jungle. There he found her with ten mortal corpses laying on the grass, all soulless and inert, with only a small bite wound in the back of their heads. Five were human- three man and two female of various ages, while the other five were horned Apokryphes, also ranging in age and gender.        

"Hello dear- I got you a present!" Lyva announced excitedly, stepping forward to hug him and gesture, "I thought, if you wanted to look less like that scum Kain, you could take one of them- or more, you can always shapeshift between them when you learn how again. Surprise!"
