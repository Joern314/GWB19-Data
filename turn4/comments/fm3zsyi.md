The trelim tribe having lost most of its leader ship and looking for a way to appease kain decided to help the members of the Gelbrous tribe with the grand bridge 

so construction began. The trelim trying time make them selves useful to there new friend began guiding others to the mountains.  Where they would mine, the trelim didnâ€™t know much in the way mining like the gelbrous. But they became the ones who physically dragged back large stone block to the construction site so they may be placed with in the every growing bridge  

This went on for several years and the grand bridge of stone blocks,  grew step by step foot by foot, it was becoming a real accomplishment the mortals could be proud of .
