# The Queen and the Great One

Oryllia hadn't spoken with her friend Malaphet in a long time, and considering she had kept his first gift to her, she thought it was time to pay him a visit.

The violet flames of the Witch-Queen blazed before the Great One, and out of a fiery gate stepped Oryllia. At her side was the eye that Malaphet had gifted her, only now it was transformed. Now it bore a set of four wings to keep itself in flight, and a group of six tendrils draped down from its form. Its singular eye now blazed with the same purple light that made up the Witch-Queen's shape.

"My friend, it has been some time. I'm glad to see you once again."
