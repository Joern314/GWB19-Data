"Purpose? Duty? Who gave you those?" Lyva echoed, gritting her teeth, "Are you some minor god like my counting snake in my hoard? NONSENSE!"    

"You said you were the dregs, but your curses could be worthwhile and your contracts could mean something- and look at me. I AM A MISTAKE! I'm some rebounded desire and divinity, I wasn't made or birthed for anything, but I'm going to own universes." Lyva announced.   

"As for you, you're never going to manage to bear the weight of evil if you just make things worse. What've you done about the unliving? Made nights harder to deal with and deprived mortals of suitable weapons. You weren't trying to bear pain, you were just trying to offload it, and you chose poorly. You can't exist as a contradiction. Get rid of the contracts, get rid of the dumb wordplay- believe me, if you know Aalaaros then you know Truth isn't all it's cracked up to be- and use Hexes and Blessings or something."    

Lyva stomped up to the forge, reached up a hand and snapped off part of her antler, throwing it into the flames. As it did, the violet flames burst into white nuclear starfire, hotter and brighter and paler than ever.    

"You've got a forge, you've got a hammer, you know how to remake things. I just want the damned screaming darkness to stop."
