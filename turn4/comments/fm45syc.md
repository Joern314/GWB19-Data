The Riders grew more and more confused as time passed on.  
Some tried to desperately fix the map but it was cursed truly.

This was the time the tribe who had the prophet of the red god traveled by, they saw those who tried to gain higher understanding to become weak, some even went mad by trying to read the map but see it constantly wrong.

The prophet pointed toward the night sky and a bright red star could be seen, shining ever strong toward the south.  
He proclaimed this to be the red star, the star of the red god, clearly, the stars are not meant for people, but the gods.

#Prompt: The Eyes Wide Open  
[-1 act: A bright red star to the south (think the North Star, but south).]

In the end, the land was empty. The maps lie broken on the ground, alone in the plains.  
This did change the Blood Riders, matters to learn and understand things were seem as less important, only thing that matters were your own abilities.  
Be they riding, fighting, strength, leadership, crafting.  
It was the physical acts that were seen as important.
