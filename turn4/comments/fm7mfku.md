The vault door slammed shut behind them, the heat no long intensifying, but energy still lingered like a boiling hot day.         

Lyva led her to another building within the hoard, this one almost cathedral like with great windows over the gilded city, vast mirrors and yet a floor covered in carpets, divans and soft couches.

Lyva collected several items of sailors she had known, a greatcoat, high boots, a bright sash and other things she considered piratey, since that was the closest mortal occupation she could think of to the Knave.
