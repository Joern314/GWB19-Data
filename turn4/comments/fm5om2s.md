Yashqal gazed at the dancing folk, humans and yashool alike, and saw how they were at the mercy of the elements. They planted seeds at the wrong times and the seeds failed, for floods or for cold for that had no way to divine the will of Thool. Though they still practiced their dances, they were often at odds with one another, because of their disorganization. 

Yashqal wondered how he could provide some order into the lives of these mortals, so he went to Thool, a god who knew a little something about the cycles of the world. 

“Mysterious Thool, mortals look up into the sky, but it provides no answers, how will they know of the passing seasons, and the proper time for hunting, planting, and other such things?”
