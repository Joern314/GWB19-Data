"Sure but I'll just double my wager, two souls, two bodies, I don't care about his leg - what Tondr-" She wondered, only to scream as lightning struck beside her, and she reflected the dazzling light all around.     

"Ha! Missed and you're not the only one with new tricks!" Lyva grinned and tensed, tail coiling like a spring, "Behold, *Prismari Style*!"    

Then she leapt her liquid mercury form condensing in the air to a familiar looking large blob shape. Yet unlike normal Prismari, she hardened her metal body so the impact felt like a solid punch, then jumped back off.      

"Ha! See- actually, wait!" The metal blob rolled and squelched over and reformed into Lyva standing over the corpses, her body entirely shimmering fluid metal, and  lacking one major feature.   

"No hatches my brave hero. Sorry but no breaking into my hoard with  this me- and no more lightning unless you want to hit your supper." She nodded to the bodies around her feet and giggled villainous ly.
