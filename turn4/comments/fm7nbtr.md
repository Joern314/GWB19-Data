If he died here would things be better he questioned himself as the pain set and he his arms where sent toward his chest as malaphet began to devour him 

“No no they won’t.... what would mother do.” Kain asked and suddenly an idea. Something he hadn’t done in a very long time 

His robe dissipated into his body as if you protect it and then kain clawed at his chest leave a deep gash. Suddenly in the depth of space black lightning hit kain body as it began to distort and grow large muscles and bone breaking cracking growing larger and larger 

When it was done the enveloping Malaphet would have a hard time keeping hold of his new prey a monstrous giant of black lightning chard flesh and twisted exposed muscle that was one hundred and twenty meter tail it let out a a roar that boomed  like thunder 


It seemed in his desperation kain created a strange twisted body that was the amalgamation of the two sphere the father and son shared 

“**NOW IS NOT THE TIME MALAPHET** .” The now twisted giant the was kain roared it sounded closer to Malaphet own speech then that if a normal god  and then suddenly it grab one of the gods tentacle and began biting at it with its own mouth ripping and tearing at it it seemed even trying to bite out an eye
