“**THAT ISN’T HOW THUNDER AND THE DRUM WORK MS.LYVA I BEAT IT AS SOON AS I CAN AFTER, OR I WOULD HELP. I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR MR KAIN TO TALK**” tondra said with a politeness one wouldn’t expect from one constantly yelling 

Prismari was pummelling   Kain face as the fell then floated “answer us tell me who you are.... “ Prismari pleaded 

“Yes let it all out beat me !!! I deserve it....” kain said with a laugh then stopped and considered his options, he could fit these two together and he didn’t really want to anyway... he just didn’t want to tell Prismari the truth either 

let us land first and make your lady friend stop.” Kain said with a laugh... he seemed to be enjoying the beat down a little to much 

Prismari held out a hand to the approaching lyva trying to tell her to wait but was to late and she was able to hit kain me last time
