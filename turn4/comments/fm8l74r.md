Lyva lay and waited for him to calm, happy to lie, relax and enjoy affection. She did bristle at his last words, and bit him playfully, "It's plenty big! It's just smaller because most of my hoard's in the planet, you could spend days wandering here easy. And... it's nice to lie and doze with you. Maybe because we're so old."    

She sighed and wriggled her way into his arms, pulling him to hug her as her tail coiled around his leg, "But fine, just hold me, and I'll move my body somewhere less... awkward."     

Above, the brasslike "sky" of the hoard showed an infernal scene as Lyva opened her eyes in the midst of a volcano, and scrambled up and out, teleporting to the prismatic plains in case he wanted to leave.
