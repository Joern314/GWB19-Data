"Forgive me? I don't need forgiven, I'm not below you, I'm not a demigod." Lyva pouted, hands on her hips, "I'm a Goddess, your equal and I love you. It's a *present* Prismari! I'm giving a present!"    

She blinked at the sword and folded her arms resolutely, turning to a strange shimmering reflective metal. "No. Other dumb old gods might have said it's evil before,  but we're supreme here, we can choose, we made this world, they belong to us."   

"If you want to fight, I'll take you on Pris, but only if we bet. If you win, you can have them all, body and soul. If I win, you have to eat one body and one soul. Maybe then you'll eat the rest with me?" She asked demurely, as if asking him on a date.
