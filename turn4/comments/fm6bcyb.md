Lyva winced. She wasn't a goddess of space, her hoards wasn't even a true plane of existence, they couldn't battle a god. But Kain didn't need to know that.    

"Of course I..." Lyva lifted her tail, expanding it to become a huge jaw portal and bit at Kain. Yet as soon as she did, she paused, coughed, and abruptly threw him back out, sputtering as she did.    

"Ew ew ew, no, NO, yuck!" She flicked her tongue desperately as if trying to get a taste out. "No. Sorry Prismari, but I'm Greed. I can store away anything I WANT but I don't want this scum. I have no desire for him so he won't stay in, I don't want him hearing and seeing through me, especially when I'm with you!"  

She sighed, looking embarassed, "Just throw him into space. He can stay there until you want. If he sets foot in the planet I'll take his feet and hoard those."   

 [ I think malaphet has some Kain ideas for space!]
