The Hunting Grounds were the ancestral home of humanity. Made by Rictus and traveled by his people under the guidance of the Iron Judges it was home to many nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes of humans, using the magical arrows Rictus had given their forefathers to hunt.

Their is however one town where the Iron Judges meet to deliberate on recent events, religious matters and tribal business. The place is called Sanctuary. Where outside the tribes often squabble over the best places to hunt, sources of water or the best trees to make arrows from in Sanctuary the Iron Law reigns supreme and no one dares to break the law given to humanity by their creator and patron Rictus.

It is no one wonder then that the center of worship for Rictus is also Sanctuary. The people of Sanctuary try to live by the Iron Law and try to educate visitors on the Iron Law in accordance with the teachings of Rictus.

Among the people of the Hunting Grounds the story of a very special young boy is often told. He bragged to his friends that he could shoot his arrows farther than them, farther than their fathers and farther even than the hunters of the tribes, who were known to be the best shots on Primus.

The boy's friends were fed up with his bragging and demanded for him to show them. The boy couldn't however resist bragging one last time and let his friends pick where to shoot. And they to teach him a lesson wanted him to shoot the sky itself. 

The boy was not perturbed. He knew he could not possibly reach the sky with an arrow, but giving up without even trying seemed pathetic to him. And so he climbed a tall tree to improve his odds. He took aim and fired. And to the astonishment of the boy and his friends the arrow turned into a streak of silver and in the heavens stars appeared in the shape of an Arrow.

After the disappearance of the gods, the fall of the old empires and the end of the era of legend and myth some mortals were glad to be rid of the disturbance the gods represented to the world. Some people however missed the gods and the more colorful advanced world they represented. 

Among them were a group of Apokryph and humans, who wanted to convince their gods to return. And that marked the begin of the construction of the Empty Temple.

Meant to be a temple to the gods like many stories of old talk about, the Empty Temple started out as a hut. A luxurious hut, but a hut nontheless. For the mortals it would have been a splendid home, but to the gods it was not. 

Crude boulders, rocks, planks of wood, hides of animals, gems and whatever else the mortals could conceive of as building materials were used to enlargen, enrich and spruce up the empty temple. It was all in all a try to bribe the gods into returning. 

And even when the gods finally did return after millenia they still did not pay attention to the Empty Temple. For all it was it was still just a hut after all. And so the Apokryph and humans keep building and changing the Empty Temple, year after year, day after day, doomed to never be finished.
