# The Unholy Land of the Witch-Queen

The Wastes of Pain stood as an exemplary testament to Oryllia's nature, the curses she planned to sew into the world. And so, she channeled more of her divinity into the land. The blackened land became a place of exile for the nearby tribes. Those deemed profane were cast out to the Wastes, where many would perish from starvation, the lakes of poison, the swarms of Umbral Locusts tearing their flesh, and the aggressive Blightbeasts trampling unsuspecting wanderers to death.

The Wastes represented the ejection of profanity from the tribes in the west of the Blood Plains, the self named "Turmoiled". Any time a people acted and spoke uncleanly, they were exiled into the Wastes, left to die and join with the Witch, who smiled over their curses. This was done to remain pure and to prevent incurring the wrath of the Witch who ruined their world.
