Among the people of the Hunting Grounds the story of a very special young boy is often told. He bragged to his friends that he could shoot his arrows farther than them, farther than their fathers and farther even than the hunters of the tribes, who were known to be the best shots on Primus.

The boy's friends were fed up with his bragging and demanded for him to show them. The boy couldn't however resist bragging one last time and let his friends pick where to shoot. And they to teach him a lesson wanted him to shoot the sky itself. 

The boy was not perturbed. He knew he could not possibly reach the sky with an arrow, but giving up without even trying seemed pathetic to him. And so he climbed a tall tree to improve his odds. He took aim and fired. And to the astonishment of the boy and his friends the arrow turned into a streak of silver and in the heavens stars appeared in the shape of an Arrow.

### The Gates

To commemorate the founding of Epoidos the mages of the city performed an ancient ritual, given to them by the Sorcerer. And so there in the sky a constellation in the form of two gates appeared symbolizing the White Gates of Epoidos.

### Segil'reld, The Great Bird

Seven bright stars, all with a green and purple hue marked the beak, wing tips, two legs, the end of the tail feathers, and one at the heart of the being, were filled in with duller stars to complete the image. All glistened like bright jewels in the heavens and the beak of the great bird was anchored above the Temple-Caves of Nkan'gbamo. It would be said that the bird always flew home.

### The Wall

/u/Senelaria

To remind mortals of the day a horde of the Unliving had broken forth from below and a furious goddess was born, Glypha put a constellation in the sky in the form of a wall, so the mortals would know that even walls couldn't save them, if they roused her ire.

### The Empty Temple

/u/horatius-cocles, /u/Gwydion-Drys

[Turn 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fsee67/endless_pantheon_turn_4/fm4xmn7/)

After the disappearance of the gods, the fall of the old empires and the end of the era of legend and myth some mortals were glad to be rid of the disturbance the gods represented to the world. Some people however missed the gods and the more colorful advanced world they represented. 

Among them were a group of Apokryph and humans in the Hunting Grounds, who wanted to convince their gods to return. And that marked the begin of the construction of the Empty Temple.

Meant to be a temple to the gods like many stories of old talk about, the Empty Temple started out as a hut. A luxurious hut, but a hut nontheless. For the mortals it would have been a splendid home, but to the gods it was not. 

Crude boulders, rocks, planks of wood, hides of animals, gems and whatever else the mortals could conceive of as building materials were used to enlargen, enrich and spruce up the empty temple. It was all in all a try to bribe the gods into returning. 

And even when the gods finally did return after millenia they still did not pay attention to the Empty Temple. For all it was it was still just a hut after all. And so the Apokryph and humans keep building and changing the Empty Temple, year after year, day after day, doomed to never be finished.

The Empty Temple is situated on a hill near Sanctuary. Its internal structures are comprised of megaliths, which serve as the bones of the structure. The backroom serves as a small workshop where primitive statues of the gods are hewn from flint and limestone.

At the entrance figures maybe depicting the Sorcerer and Rictus can be found, but due to the age of the statues and the crudeity of the fabrication it is hard to tell.

Inside the main room two pits serve as sacrifice pits to burn offerings to the god in.

As it is meant to serve as a home to the gods many furs, seats and primitive tables can be found within the side rooms as well as sleeping and fire places. There are no walls per se, but with wooden struts and sticks connected to the megaliths a framework for walls is formed. The "walls" themselves consist of furs, dried foliage and wicker.

The "walls" are painted in primitive colors, mostly depicting mythological scenarios, like the creation of humans and Apokryph, the laying of Azrakal, Rak being dragged to death by the Sorcerer or the first Iron Judge sentencing Ras, the blood emperor.

### Nkan'gbamo

/u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

[Turn 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flpo5p4/)

Temple-caves with large square passages, rooms, and stairs underneath The Shattered Mountains. The walls and ceiling are littered with the jewels from when Gon formed the mountain range and glitter with any source of light. At the deepest point, the largest chamber serves as an audience hall with a single stone throne where Gon met with all the various minor gods he had pulled into his service. A smaller room off of this chamber served as his inner sanctum and living quarters.

### Nkloig Sekzil, The Mouth of Creation

/u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flu8tjs/)

A deep crevice where the goblins are said to have crawled out from. Home to a large number of Ranos priests and serves as Gon's holy land (influence is measured by the percent of the population that lives underground.)

### The Sea Spike

/u/Horatius-Cocles 

[Turn 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flum9pd/)

In good view of both continents the single highest mountain of the world made purely of obsidian rises high above the ocean surface into the clouds. It is called the Sea Spike.

### The Shattered Mountains (Segbiggolod Linenko)

[Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flm48zh/)

Dropped on the second continent by Gon during its creation, The mountain range is full of jagged cracks and crevices that form caves. The nature of their formation left the tops of the mountains broken into sharp points. During their formation, Gon placed large numbers of jewels under and there remain great riches to be found.

### Skaal'gbaldol, the Sky Holder

/u/Rhaegar1994

[Turn 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/floapi9/)

A sixteen mile high mountain in the form of a Nkarlen down on one knee with his hands up like he is holding up the sky. The source of many legends; he is rumoured to have been the first goblin hero.

## Lifeforms

### Blood Hunter

Description: Highly dangerous, intelligent, cruel, strong and bloodthirsty creature. Lives in the Savage Jungle.

### Hoarding Crab (Nkelims'kzelir)

/u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flymgvg/)

These strange hermit like crabs had exoskeletons of gray and brown that match the colors of the caves, but the back half of their body glows intensely and the gather up jewels and slowly craft them into shell like houses with mud and muck that when they occupy them causes them to glow through all the embedded colors like some crazy light show. These little creatures will take jewels from anywhere they can get them, including jewelry. If one manages to find one of their little nest holes, there is almost always a deposit of all kinds of jewels there.

### Magic Eater Fungus

/u/Horatius-Cocles 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flum9pd/)

A small symbiotic fungus living by eating magic. It lives in predators and eats the magic of their prey so they can feed on other animals.

### Nightwalker

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/fluduj9/)

**Description:** The Nightwalker is a symbiotic predator. In its primary form, it is similar to a wolf stalking through the utter darkness of the Endless Woods in the Rift. On occasion one or a few of these creatures might venture into the material plane but only occasionally.

If an individual mortal is able to fend off this wolf-like creature it takes gooey form and tries to bond itself to the person. The bonding process acts like sickness and kills the host through ensuing fever and auto-immune reactions. In 1 out of 10 cases however, the Nightwalker forms a symbiotic relationship with the host.

The bond with the Nightwalker endows it's with a sense of echolocation, though interpreting the new sensory input takes time and experience. The immune system of the host is also strengthened somewhat after fighting off the infection like the bonding process and their blood turns slightly acidic.

### Rift Tree

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/fluduj9/)

**Description:** Rift Trees don't have a fixed form. They can bee gnarly and weather-beaten, as high as mammoth trees or shaped like giant mushrooms. The single thing they have in common is they are all made from Rift Crystal. Plantlife tends to grow bigger and faster near Rift Trees. The curious forms the Rift Trees take in a patch of Rift Woods stem from these auras, speeding up plant growth, overlapping.

Rift Trees survive and spread by consuming matter and ambient energy and can thereby grow in any environment providing these. The presence of Rift Trees cools down the temperatures of their surroundings and makes it thereby easier for a patch of Rift Wood to spread.

Once in a time, a Tree will spawn a glowing pear-shaped Rift Fruit. If a fruit is planted alone in a field a single Rift Crystal Tree will sprout. To get rid of a Tree one has to sever all the roots of it. In a patch of Rift Wood, the roots of the Rift Crystal Trees grow together and connect to each other forming in essence one giant Rift Tree.

The Trees themselves look like described above only carved from blue or violet crystals and grow at the entrances to the Rift or in the Rift itself naturally. 

The fruit of the glows and be fashioned into a lamp, used by the Rift Keepers to guide the souls of the dead along to the afterlife.

### Vanilin

Created by Lyva, [Turn 3](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/fm061ji/)     
Description: A large scaled warm blooded creature with extremely tough jaws to scrape at metal, and the ability to work said metals into its scales, like a huge pangolin. Hunting such creatures would help those who would dwell here to use the metallic scales for their own ends, or could even potentially farm the creature.

#### The Echoing Jungle

Creator: Lyva, ( u/smcadam )

[Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flytqr2/)

The jungle across the north of the "human continent" is equatorial and warm throughout the year, though often racked by wild weather. It is largely made of huge trees sprawling 100-300 feet tall, with distinct layers of the canopy, and full of fruit, berries, herbs and edible plantlife that rapidly regrows. Thanks to the Hex of Darkness, the lower shadowy layers are almost perpetually screaming.

The lowest levels of the forest feel almost underground, a labyrinth of roots like mangrove roots which hold vast troves of fungi. The Tralinhoof, a sinuous boneless species without ears or eyes dwells here and is the primary predator, operating almost entirely on smell. Thanks to thick hide and lack of hard tissue it is very resistant to the blasts of death, and hunts with surprising ferocity.

The second level, on shelves of old matter on the roots themselves, is home to younger trees, bushes, shrubs and wrapped in twilight at best. Agile Nehreeans, six limbed spidery reptiles vault over the weak ground here and use a poisonous bite to bring prey down before outlasting them.

The low canopy is home to the most life, much of it herbivourous and navigating using vast vines, thick branches, and huge webs. Monkeys, colourful birds, flying reptiles, snakes, lizards, sloths, tree pangolins and all manner of insects as well as mortal dwellers tend to roam in this realm. The webs are creations of Lightsnares, ghostly gigantic spiders that are somewhat transparent, and actually snare webs to impress and attract mates.

The top layers of the canopy are bright and the most fruitful, though also the most volatile and dangerous on slender branches. Fireflies provide light here almost permanently, keeping the screams from sounding, and many species of sensitive bats, birds, flying serpent and tiny monkey like creatures roam here.

#### The Great Canyon

Once a foreboding and lifeless scar on the world, The Great Canyon that divided the continent called Primus was now finally healing more then 8000 years after the wound had first been dealt. Moisture was rich here as it was funneled up from the southerly winds before getting trapped between the miles high ridges that made up the walls of the canyon, leading to a thick blanket of ever-present rain clouds covering the sky.

Under these clouds soared a multitude of life, some animals aimlessly drifted in the wind while others soared with wings as long as a man stands tall and everything in between. The plantlife itself clung to the sides of the ridges, some of the largest plants growing upward several kilometers from the base of the canyon to the tallest ridges while the floor of the canyon had a river that ran through the middle towards the sea and was coated in many tall trees, each competing for the limited amount of sun that shines down on the ravine.

Most animal life here flies in one method or another while most plants rely on alternate sources of energy then the sun to supplement their diet

#### The Great Salt

Bioformed: [Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flwu3ii/)

The Great Ocean is abounding in microscopic life, particularly algae and plankton that form the basis of its food chain. Larger species like the Kymen Algae bond together into long serpent like chains, that can sometimes stretch dozens of metres long during the day.
Larger plants dominate the sea bed, with many varieties of sea weed and brine trees making food via photosynthesis and even developing fruits of sorts in order to spread. In the deeper regions, Molt Fields, large fungi claim energy from geothermal activity instead, and cover the seabed near volcanoes in a coppery thorny field.
Some species of coral and anemone can be found in the shallows, but there is not currently the variety needed for coral reefs. [I figure that's worth a seperate biome]

The vast majority of fauna in the ocean is herbivorous, with fish being the most common- species like tuna, salmon, haddock, herring, pike- along with Gildfish who stick shiny objects to their adhesive scales, Hylatlung, long sea snakes with a head at either end of their bodies, and Fareehans, gigantic fish on a scale with whales who sift and consume plankton.
Jellyfish, octopi, celaphopods, crabs and arachnids, sea scorpions, diving birds and eels survive primarily on scavenging, but are too fragile to properly hunt and kill prey.
Predators of the ocean include mertlings, feral half ape half serpent creatures, farwhals with long lance horns, shield sharks with armoured bony skulls and maws, Ripple Swarms who are small hive minded fish that sacrifice a few with every meal, sometimes causing horrific chain explosions, caprimer who are shaggy, goat fish hybrids, leonmer which are shaggy beasts covered in symbiotic weeds, and trilalungs, large winged rays with long tails who can glide above the water.

The main biohazard of the ocean is Netterkin, a large sea snake with poisonous skin, horns and a resemblance to a serpentine dragon.

[Turn 3](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flva0pl/)

A volcanic archipelago of Islands off the northern coast of Primus, created by Lyva triggering a massive eruption after a sleep. It has a vibrant and quite peaceful ecosystem with few predators built on the volcanic ash of the islands eruption. Trees growing here were tough and hardy, grass was thick, and she added peaceful creatures like kiwis, oxen, horses, goats, apes and many species of birds and snakes across the hills. In the shallow waters, large amphibious geckos as big as horses roamed, and many bright tropical insects.

### The Second Continent, Reloik'lakzek (Name Pending)
