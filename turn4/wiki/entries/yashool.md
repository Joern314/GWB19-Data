"If it is blood they want, it is blood they shall have". Thool appeared to the leader of the newly created living trees on the edge of the forests. "My name is Thool. With the helo of the god Yaqshal, we have given you life. What will you call yourselves?"

"We are the creation of Yashqal and Thool, so we are the Yashool. We will protect the woodlands for the rest of our days and honor the gift of fidelity" the biggest of the trees responded.
