### Azrakal

**Appearance**: A flayed man with little cloths.  
Previously: A human male with black tattoos over almost his entire body. No hair and wears simple cloths that covers very little of him.  

**Spheres**: Blood and Power

**Plans and Style**: Desires blood, lot's of blood, so much blood. Will create short lived empires that goes out to capture people for blood sacrifices. Also create Vampires. Mostly being Evil.

**Origin**: Born from a divine drop of blood.

**Further explanation**:

### The Forgotten

**Player**: /u/Abacadaren

**Spheres**: Lost things and Sentiments

**Appearance**: The Forgotten appear as a pile of discarded scrap and items, like a junkyard given life. Broken dolls, Old tools, Books with torn pages, all set in motion of one united goal: to have back what once meant so much to them.

As far as sound, The Forgotten are in a way able to speak, either through old and worn voice boxes and speakers, or the imitation of speech through the crunching and creaking of it's piles.

**Plans and Style**: The Forgotten intend to be remembered and to reduce the number of things that are lost. Their ultimate goal is, in a way, their own destruction and the removal of their furthered creation

**Origin**: Since the beginning of creation, creations have been set to the ways side. Things that once meant so much to someone can come to mean nothing in time. It's hard to remember exactly when you forgot, just that you forgot it. When The Forgotten tried to not be is anyone's guess.

**Further explanation**:

Lost things here in refers to second death style things, lost to the point no one else would be able to find/connect. This includes lost memories as well, to tie into Sentiment. The dead are a difficult case, so to set it as clear and best as possible I deal in lost things, not lost people. Spirits and souls can remember things and pass on their memories, but they do not count as remembering things themselves.

Sentiment refers to connection and emotion, like love or care (though it can be negative sentiments). The feelings one has towards a favorite stuffed animal, or the love for a family member.

### Gon Gryn, Vengeance Reborn

**Player**: /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

**Spheres**: Earth and Vengeance

**Appearance**:
A tall and muscular half-bird, half-elven man - a race known as the Gryn - with earthy brown skin covered in bright white scars. The most noticeable of these is the scar over his left eye. In place of hair, he has a crest of feathers similar in appearance to a filled-in native american chief’s headdress. These feathers fade from a bright green to a vibrant purple, with three longer feathers fading from purple to green. Green eyes flecked with purple seem to be full of intensity and he usually wears an odd smirk. Below the knees his legs become those of an eagle and end in sharp black talons. Gon doesn’t seem particularly picky about what he wears, and can often be found wearing whatever clothes are provided to him by Lyva. He does slightly favor dressing in white, but for formal occasions he dresses in a green feather robe; a memento of his “father”. In battle, he wears traditional Arakyl feathermail over a purple padded tunic. The only thing he consistently has on his person is a particular sword known as The Retaliator with its plain dark leather sheath and belt.

**Plans and Style**:
Gon has only recently ascended into godhood and the shift from a demi-god to a full fledged divine being has left a mark on him. He intends to make the best of his new powers and rather simply enjoy himself. The fetters of fate, however, may not be so easy to sever.

Being the amnesiatic form of a god from another existence, Gon has a strange mix of apathy and curiosity about him. He has a knack for understanding magic and seeks it out with enthusiasm, but tends to laze around otherwise. Outwardly friendly, Gon only truly enjoys the company of those who have become consumed by some desire; he enjoys seeing them work tirelessly towards their goals. Especially if those goals include revenge.

**Origin**:
Gon was a semi-divine being created partially from the soul fragment of a god with the same name from the Fire Realm and the memories and personality of the phoenix god, Nekalos Toneyl. His former self was apparently destroyed along with Nek’s home realm, but the god attempted to achieve resurrection in a new plane of existence by placing a fragment of his soul in the banished phoenix god. Interference from the Serpent Goddess Celastra of Space, Secrets, and Shadows caused the plan to fail and Gon’s memories were stolen and placed into a demigoddess known as Lyva. Following the recreation of his body as a demigod, the amnesiatic Gon - known as Hunger - found himself somewhat enamored with the demigoddess and her greed. Seeking refuge from a dysfunctional family relationship with Nek and his demigoddess daughter, Hylatka, Hunger decided he would stay with Lyva. Once Lyva had achieved true divinity, Hunger agreed to travel away from the world with her to seek his own divinity elsewhere.

Divinity itself, however, has a price; as he traveled with Lyva, Gon was able to modify the so-called “Toneyl Divinity Manipulation Magic” developed by Hylatka and create a divine spark by siphoning the power of souls consumed by his blade into himself. Unfortunately, this seems to have had some side effects…

### Lyva

**Player:** /u/Smcadam       

**Spheres:** Greed and Metal     
             
**Appearance**: Lyva’s usual form is an athletic metallic goddess with curling horns amidst her long hair, and a long tail. Various panels and scales on her can open like drawers and doors to a pocket dimension where she hoards and collects… well, anything that catches her attention.                        
She normally flaunts her wealth by wearing a vast diversity of jewellery and dresses. She can shapeshift, normally changing what metal she seems composed of, or turning into a metallic asian style dragon occasionally.      

**Origin**: Lyva was originally “born” in a divine accident, from another deities greed breaking off. She’s tempered a little bit by wisdom and cunning since her birth, but fundamentally just wants everything. She quickly acquired adoptive parents, friends and lovers, and used them to ascend to full godhood, before leaving to claim her own planet.

### Oryllia, the Witch-Queen

**Player**: /u/DragoneyeCreations

**Spheres**: Hexes and Contracts

**Appearance**: Oryllia appears as a feminine figure made of violet fire, with metallic pieces adorning her like armor. Most notably, a plate with long curling horns covers her eyes like a blindfold. She wields a hammer, covered in runes.

**Plans and Style**: Oryllia, being a goddess of hexes and contracts, seeks to curse both the land and individuals through various means. She lures mortals in via contracts with her, which will nearly always end in the mortal being cursed. Primarily, she will be feared, and those who actively worship her will be those pushed to the fringes of society for being profane.

**Origins**: Oryllia was born out of the dregs of creation, the profanity, the sludge that soon became the pit from which all of her Hexes came from.

**Further Explanation**: Oryllia is an evil aligned god, so expect plenty of chaos to come from her. It’ll be a mix of simple tricks and horrendous evil.

### Rictus

**Spheres**: Law and Hunt

**Description**: Rictus generally appears in human form. The form of the man he was born as. He is of a tall but lean build and is clothed in the leather garb of a hunter. He has shoulder long, brown hair with gray streaks. He wears his hair bound back behind his head in a braid. Rictus has blue-gray eyes and a thick, full beard. His beard has the same color as his hair. The right half of his face is scarred with a big claw mark.

When he appears as the god of the hunt he often wears a green cloak. This hides his face in darkness under the cloaks hood, showing only the eyes of a predator, glowing in the dark of the hood. He also carries the full apparel of a hunter.

When he appears as the god of law he appears in armor and wearing a heavy pelt coat, carrying an executioner's sword and a law book, seemingly made from iron.

**Personality**: Rictus despite his ascension millennia ago still is mostly like the mortal man he once was. Rictus likes to look out for his people and see that they are provided for as he always has as one of the hunters of his hometown. On the other hand he is unmoving in punishing those that break the laws and that endanger the well-being of people at large.

**Background**: Rictus grew up in a small town in the mountains. Later on he had learned the trade of a hunter.

He lead the typical life of a human. He had a family. He was involved in occasional fights. He aged and slowed down, but gained in experience. He joined the elders of his hometown. Rictus learned to value the peace and sense of community, so everyone could work and live in relative prosperity. As far as was possible in a part of the world regularly plagued by raiders, vampires and ghouls. 

One day a group of wandering monks called the Logothets had marched through his hometown. Rictus listened and learned from the Logothets about the nature of reality and divinity as taught by the god called the Outsider. Mortals were normally not privy to such information

For Rictus all this discussion was too theoretical. It was a bunch of talk about the theoretical construct of the mind and the makeup of nature as a whole. Nothing that really helped him in doing his duty. Though he never really forgot what he he had heard.

The priests had wandered on disappointed. Rictus however spent much of his time contemplating the words of the Logothets, when he was out alone at night. Or sitting and waiting for the best shot on one of his hunts.

During a hunting accident where he was shot and left for dead by another hunter. He lay in the snow bleeding and feeling his live drift away. So he started praying for his family, that they were taken care of. To the gods so that he might find a good place in the afterlife. Ans so he started remembering the words of all the priests he had heard. In his hour of death he could feel the words of the Logothets from so long ago gain a new dimension. He felt something happening. A deep understanding of the world around filled him. He felt, that if he reached out he could touch things that normally were only abstracts to mortals.

In his life he had been familiar with two things, hunting and the law. He reached out for the understanding of these things he knew so well. And so he ascended.

He left his homeworld after an apocalyptic war against a god called the Shadow. And while the war was won and the Shadow vanquished the world became hostile to gods. And so he moved to a new world. Where he created humanity and built a world for mortals confronting another great evil alongside fellow divine beings called the Master of the Abyss.

Wherever Rictus turned those bent on unjust destruction and domination seemed to abound. And with the world safe once more he decided to strike out and do what he did best, bring the law to protect people and hunt down those who broke it.

### The Sorcerer

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fo2h2r/game_19_endless_pantheon_applications/flcurqi/)

**Spheres:** Magic and Death

**Appearance:** The Sorcerer is humanoid in appearance. What distinguishes him from a normal human however is his grey skin, which is covered in tattoos and runic markings, retelling his life story to those who can interpret them.

He is normally clothed in splendours travelling clothes and wears a hooded cloak. His eyes are representative of a dark night sky filled with stars.

**Plans and Style:** Magic, Death and the Afterlife are linked. Expect to see as much in-game.

**Origin:** The Sorcerer was once the prophet of a god of magic and darkness before he rose to the rank of a demigod and finally ascended to full godhood. In the absence of his once patron deity, he himself took over the leadership of his people. And now he wanders the multiverse in search of a new world that could make an apt permanent home for his people, after their erstwhile world suffered catastrophe after catastrophe.

**Further Explanation:** The Sorcerer was once an idealistic youth trying to follow in his patron's footsteps to be a force of good. Repeated betrayals by his closest allies have made him pragmatic and weary and have shifted his focus from looking out for everyone to looking out for his people.

### Sunda

/u/StarOfTheSouth

**Appearance:** Sunda is a chimera. The back half of a goat, the front half and head of a lion. His tail is a serpent, on his back he bares the wings of a bat (appropriately sized), and small horns curl back over his head.

**Spheres:** Animals and Wilds

**Plans and Style:** I mostly plan on mutating and combining animals, taking what we already have and twisting it into something new.

**Origin:** One of Lyva's scales broke loose, combined with the last remnants of that Act Feyrun threw through the sun, and turned into Sunda.

**Further Explanation:** Not really sure what needs to be elaborated on, as I'm mostly just planning on doing character stuff this game. No big plans from me.

Panoptes is a tall figure. Almost human. It just has hundreds of eyes all over its head. The  Panoptes means the all-eyed or allseer. 

Panoptes would look out into the Rift and the world and keep track of mortal lives and lifespans.

### Cosmogony I

[In the distant future...]

The Shaman moved closer to the fire, beckoning both children and adults to sit down and to listen to the tales and myths of their ancestors. He coughed once, put down his walking stick, and stretched and shook his arms and legs in preparation.

Then the tribesmen grew silent, and the shaman began to dance and speak, enacting the very origin of the world they were all living in...

***

In the beginning, there was the void. And from the void came the first darkness, and with it came Sarah. And as the void vanished, Yashqal began to dance.
But around the void there also was the profane, from which the Witch Oryllia rose, cursing the safe darkness with nightmarish screams.

A third god had been hidden in the void, and to spot him you only need to look into the sky. The countless eyes of Malaphet watch every moment from above, but his words cannot be comprehended, so strange and weird is his mind. The sun is the biggest of his eyes, swollen with an angry red dot where Azrakal once stabbed it. And the stone everyone walks on, it is the bone of a giant skull, which Malaphet had spit out from one of his many mouths.

It is thanks to Lyva that the mortals need not live on its inside, for she filled it with her most precious possessions, sacrificing more wealth than any mortal could ever dream to have.

After the ground was formed, Kain released the air, and the Salty Knave rode the ocean that appeared in a giant flood.

Rictus then brought the first land, and he began to form the first humans, more noble than any other creature. But their bodies were without blood, and only when Azrakal gave them his own, did they awake and walk around.

Yet, immediately afterwards, he demanded they return the gift, he tried to take back the very essence the humans need to live! If not for the protector, Sarah, this would have been the end of them.

Azrakal is an evil god, and up to that moment he already had offended many of the other divine as well. Some say he even brought the Unliving as a twisted curse, others say that the Undying were beyond his powers.

Either way, that moment his offenses could no longer be tolerated. The Sorcerer brought back to life those whom Azrakal had slain, and taught them how to get to the Rift after their death. The other gods subdued Azrakal and tore off his skin, putting it on the world as an additional layer of dirt and stone.

This was not the only time the gods were fighting, there were plenty times when the world was at danger due to their violence. Malaphet once almost squeezed it into two halves, leaving a gaping trench behind. And the rumbling mountains spew fire even in this day, created by Sunda who fought with his mother Lyva.

There also were peaceful scenes of cooperation, like when Thool crafted the moon from a tooth of Malaphet, or when Gon Gryn, Prismari and Sunda gathered stones for the second continent, or when Shilo won against the other spirits of grain, or when Prismari began the legends of heroes. There even was a comet, who brought the Essence of Life and gave our world a spin, such that the sun would reach all the lands equally.

Countless more stories are there, of the children of the gods, and their grandchildren, the smaller gods like the Recorder, and the bigger ones like the Gargantuan Snake.

But those are for another time...

***

The shaman's speech and dance ended.

Casually he tried to play over his exhaustion, leaning against the cave walls.

After a moment of silence, somebody asked: "What happened to the gods? Why aren't they around us right now?" The shaman coughed once and said: "They... have to rest, needed a break from creation." He smiled. "Just like I need a break right now. Is the cooking finally done?"

### Apokryph-Society

/u/Gwydion-Drys

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flua9lf/)

In mainstream Apokryph-society people are born into one of three castes. The castes are determined by the runic markings on their bodies they are born with. These marks are interpreted by the Sorcerer's priests or other representatives how to at birth.

The three castes and their societal roles are as follows:

**Philosophers** are the administrative caste. Their caste provide civic leaders, priests and scholars. They are born with magically enhanced intellect.

**Guardians** are the martial caste of the Apokryph-society. They serve as warriors, police as well as intelligence gatherers and in times of need assassins. They are born with magically enhanced speed, strength, dexterity and agility.

**Citizens** are the working caste of the Apokryph. Artists, artisans, farmers, hunters and every other profession requiring workers is part of this caste. They are born with magically enhanced endurance, patience and health.

**Mages** are born with an intuitive grasp of magic and extreme magical talent. They play a separated role in society. They are not bound by the restrictions of the castes. Their role is to teach the different castes how to harness their innate magical powers and to use their magic effectively and to keep the magical knowledge of the Apokryphs. They also are tasked with guarding Apokryph-society against magical and supernatural threats.
Innate magical are awakened in a religious ceremony wherein a small animal is sacrificed by the child to awaken their power to the Sorcerer or whichever god the Apokryph follow.

#### The Rift Keepers

These are the old Apokryphes choosing to mostly stay in the Rift. They have seen other realities and are weary of the world. But they do run through reincarnation all the same, their souls just never leave the Rift anymore, unless they are sent to collect the souls of dead people from the prime material plane.

If they do this duty they are hooded and cloaked, faced hidden behind masks. They carry lanterns of Rift Tree fruit to guide along the dead. 

Rift Keeper society largely follows the conventions laid out by the Sorcerer for the future (See nations – Magocracy).

## Mortal Races

### The Apokryph

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flnbxy2/)

**Creator**: The Sorcerer, Lyva

**Amended**: -

**Description**: Apokryph looks a lot like slightly taller than average humans. They have gray skin and night-blue eyes. Their hair colors range from white and gray over brown to black. The Apokryph are born with dark runic markings on their bodies. These markings change with the stories of their lives. 

The Sorcerer and his clergy can read these markings to determine the caste an Apokryph belongs to. As these markings change the stations and powers of an Apokryph, his or her station change in life and Apokryph-society. They also have horns to commemorate the hand of Lyva in their creation.

In their veins flows a great amount of magic extending their natural life spans up to 300 years. Additionally, they have innate magical powers making them more adept at the jobs their caste is tasked with, as Apokryph society is intended by their original creator to be a caste structure. Currently, the Apokryph can however not access their life spans and innate magic as they are not yet accustomed to life in this new world.

## Nations

### The Magocracy

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flua9lf/)

The Magocracy may in future live up to its potential and become the grand nation of magic. But for now they are not more than a primitive tribe with a primitive village led by a shaman. And the caste system only crudely observed.

Though following the Sorcerer's plans the Apokryphes will in time transform their society into the Magocracy, building a nation on the material plane akin to the society of Apokryphs as established in the Rift.

With their caste society having religious and cultural meaning. No caste is higher than another in social standing. They just serve as crude way to determine one's vocation in life. Administration, sciences and works of pure intellect are done by the Philosophers. The Guardians are the defenders of the nation and work in every way the defense of the nation requires from military service and training to espionage and other less unsavory practices of war and politics. The citizens do the day to day work. Although money plays never a large role in the nation. Money is mostly frowned upon and only used to trade with foreigners.. The mages are a casteless part of society involved in all workings their help and presence is needed.

People carry a private name for personal use and a public use-name. People who distinguish themslves are given titles by the leaders of society like The Guardian or The Warrior.

As in the Rift the nation is supposed to be governed by the Inner Council. Where all Apokryphes castes and all cities contribute a councilor. The Circle is lead by the First Councilor whose job it is to break ties in votes. The Circle is advised by the mages

While all forms of art are a trade for the Citizen case the pursuit of art and knowledge in their freetime is encouraged. The masks nearly all citizens wear not only carry marks of their station in society, but can also be customized to a degree and are the prime opportunity for Apokryphs to show their artistic skills.

The nations of the Apokryphs have in many worlds left their mark by being the biggest exporters of enchanted wares and no one says they can not do it again.

**Creator**: Azrakal (/u/Plintstorm ) 

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgrobm/)

**Description**: A dagger forged with the scales of Lyva and the Blood of Azrakal. The Dagger absorbs blood, including that inside the people it stab.

### The Retaliator

**Creator**: ??? ( /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW ) 

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flg98lz/)

**Description**: 
A feather shaped blade that has turned to pitch black obsidian after being used in a ritual to ascend to godhood. A fuller ran the length of the blade and formed what would have been the stem of the feather. The shining brass or gold guard was formed in the shape of wings, the handle wrapped in a what had become rough blackened leather in a criss-cross fasion, and the pommel was in the shape of a bird's head with three eyes. Each eye was a different gemstone; emerald, ruby, and diamond.

The Retaliator was sword of divine creation that Gon brought along with him from another world. Having lost its old patron and having being used as a catalyst to create Gon's spark of divinity, it was been rendered powerless and immaterial.

**Blessings**: 0 (The blade exists as a part of Gon's divine form only, for now.)

Magical Arrows who can absorb magical energies upon killing something, so it does not explode. Magical energy is stored in the arrow until discharged. This is a secret magic and does not become general knowledge. Can only be learned by bargaining with Rictus or buying it directly for 3 acts + 2 acts for secrecy.

### Fidelity

**Creator**: Yashqal(/u/hpllamacrft)

**Created**: [Turn 1]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flhz5pr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**Description**: The true essence of all things, which can be mimicked to induce transformation. 

Every thing has a core essence. This essence can be perceived by the outward characteristics of a thing. Creatures can change their own core essence by dancing in a way that mimics the core essence of another thing. This is called showing fidelity. By showing fidelity to a thing one adopts a thing’s outward characteristics to a limited degree.
For example, a mortal looking to become tougher may show fidelity to a boulder. From observing the boulder they invent a boulder dance that captures the essence of boulders. Then the mortal practices this boulder dance for years; his skin grows tough and he is able to withstand strikes with greater resistance. In the same way, a fox dance may make someone stealthier, the gazelle dance may make someone more beautiful, the fruit dance may make someone more fertile.

### Life after Death

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgku2r/)

**Creator**: The Sorcerer

**Amended**: -

**Description**: In accordance with the laws of thermodynamics energy can not be created or destroyed only displaced and transformed. The energy of life permeating mortal bodies does not fade with death.

In animals the energy once keeping them alive turns into magical energy. The one and only source for everything magical. This magical energy has only a very short halflife and dissipates into the surrounding world as light and heat energy.

Once a mortal has reached the end of his/her/its natural life span or is killed in another way the soul is separated from the body. The body however does not die off. It is transformed into a so called “Unliving”.

The Unliving are feral beings not unlike zombies, but instead of rotting they are functionally alive bodies without minds beyond those of primitive animals only set on sating their base desires like food, drink and procreation.

If an Unliving is killed its animating force turns into magical energy as well. The transformation from magical energy to heat and light occurs in seconds. An Unliving explodes with the force of a grenade and the smaller the animal the less force/ magic is released.

To kill an Unliving its brain needs to be destroyed. Any parts attached to the head stay active.

Unclaimed souls and those claimed by the Sorcerer are after death escorted to the afterlife in the “Rift”, the Sorcerer's plane, by the mortals inhabiting the Rift and only those inhabiting the Rift.

The Unliving yearn to sate all their animal desires including food, sleep and sex at all costs. They are however biologically mortal and produce mortal children.

### The Iron Law

/u/Horatius-Cocles 

[Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgku2r/)

At any time there are a number of individuals (number will grow with time and a bigger population), chosen by Radamanthys the minor god of judges. 

People found worthy by Radamanthys gain knowledge of the law as laid down in Rictus' Iron Codex. Most people can only use the powers of an Iron Judge to enforce the Iron Law as laid down in the Iron Codex.

But due to an unexpected interference between the blood metaphysic making people more powerful and the strange metaphysics of this new world, Iron Judges who gain positions as nobles, kings, high government officials, etc gain the ability to interpret the Iron Law more flexible or in very rare cases to choose another altogether different set of laws of their own choosing to enforce.

While most people chosen by Radamanthys will stay their course and stick to the Iron Law, the power may corrupt some few individuals who use their powers not in the service of the Iron Law, but for themselves or their chosen codices of law. It falls to the Iron Inquisitors to root out these corrupt judges.

Iron Inquisitors are tasked with special duties by the god Rictus, among the most important is the neutralizing of renegade Iron Judges, who don't use their powers for justice and in unethical ways.

The Iron Judges, in turn, are bound to the strict nature of the Iron Law and are provided with knowledge of how to interpret the Law correctly and in extension how to give and render judgment correctly. After an impartial investigation of course. If a judge fails to comply with this, he is stripped of his rank and judged by an Iron Inquisitor accordingly to the Iron Law and replaced by an individual found worthy to serve. The ousted former judge then loses all his powers.

The Law is independent thereby subject to no one and to be obeyed by all. The Judges by extensions are only subject to the Iron Law, and while they may choose to worship any god and follow any mortal individual they desire, they still have to render judgment even of their king if the Iron Law demands it. 

By extension, the Judges are not susceptible to being mind-controlled or influenced even by the divine. While a god can still smite a judge, if they wish to do so, they can not in any other way interfere with a judge's work. The free will and action of a judge can NOT be tampered with under any circumstances in as far as it pertains to his duties as an Iron Judge. Their free and honest judgment in accordance with the Iron Law is a judge's first duty.

While in an ideal world everyone would live by the rule of law, many people or their gods don't support the Iron Law [yet].

The Law and its judges can render judgment on anyone who breaks the Iron Law. To do this the Judges are given the power to make reality around them conform to the Iron Law.
For example, if the Iron Law forbids the carrying of weapons, the presence of an Iron Judge would make it impossible to bear arms. Anyone carrying a weapon would find themselves unable to lift or draw the weapon. The Iron Judge would then proceed to the judgment and the meting out of punishment for the transgression of bearing arms. For a judges powers to take effect they need to proclaim a verdict by any reasonable form of communication, meaning even writing and sign language would work.

To use this power however an Iron Judge has to know one of the Iron Laws is broken. He has to be near the infraction to fix it and using this power is taxing. The greater the change to reality, the greater the fatigue a judge incurs after using this power. This can even lead to death.

However, if the cause of an infraction is supernatural the power can be fueled by energies of the supernatural entity/ magic that said infraction is coming from, not taxing the judge as much in using their power.

The only circumstance under which judgment/ punishment can be avoided to be given by an Iron Judge is to prevent greater and heavier consequences than letting crime go unpunished.

Lastly fast and swift action is often necessary. If there is a threat too big to be handled by Iron Judges or to the Iron Law itself an Iron Inquisitor can be called. Iron Inquisitors carry all the powers of the Iron Judges are for the duration of their missions however exempt from judgment themselves. They can, however, be judged after their missions are finished and their status as Iron Inquisitors revoked.

In a state of extreme emergency, where the Law isn't only threatened but can be considered non-existent because of the reigning disorder. An Iron Inquisitor can name Lawbringers.

Lawbringers are endowed with the power to actively bend reality to bring order into chaos. Where the Iron Judges can only bend reality to conform to law, a Lawbringer can bend reality to what it should be in the Lawbringer's eyes.

These powers can be revoked by an Iron Inquisitor or withdrawn by the miracle itself, if grossly misused.

The strain put on Lawbringers is the same or even greater as that put on Judges, when they bend reality.

## Planes

### The Rift

**Creator**: The Sorcerer

**Amended**: -

**Description**: The Sorcerer's very own plane between worlds. For the souls of the dead it functions as an afterlife for the Apokryph it is their home dimension. 

The Rift is a volatile, shifting and twisted mirror version of the material world. It grows and changes as the material plane does. The Rift is a place born of Magic and Death. The **Endless Woods** make up the majority of the plane. It is steeped in eternal darkness. The terrain is unreliable and distances change at will. Where an hour ago a river was flowing now a mountain could be standing.

At the center of the plane, suspended in mid air instead of a sun hovers a white city, **Oneiros**, the city of sleep.

Three kinds of dead souls are found in the Rift:

- The first are souls with no other afterlife to go to.

- The second are the faithful of the Sorcerer.

- The third are the souls of the dead Apokryph, waiting for reincarnation.

The first two kinds are judged and either allowed entrance to Oneiros, where they can sleep and dream away the time. 

If they are found unworthy they are tossed into the Endless Woods where they are forced to prey on each for eternity, while their worst nightmares take shape and torment all of them equally.

The third kind live among their living kin, but are unable to leave the Rift.

Beyond that the Rift connects to all Rift Woods of the material world. Mortals, who know how and dare to enter, will be able to go to this plane through the Rift Woods. Then they can wander the Rift until they reach a place connecting to a different patch of Rift Wood and return through there to the material plane or they find the hidden way to Oneiros, where they can try to reach their dead loved ones.

While people not privy to the secrets of mastering the Rift Woods and the Rift will be in danger of stumbling blind into this plane and never come back. Because they run afoul of the dangers of the Endless Woods, wandering through the Rift until they die. Or they stumble back into the mortal world in a random patch of Rift Wood, possibly on the opposite side of the world, driven mad by the horrors of the Endless Woods. Creatures and plants can make their way around the world in this way as well and wander into the Rift, where they become inhabitants of the Rift itself. 

Upon significant events in the material world, like the founding of an important city, a battle or the creation of an especially holy sight etc., a similar location will come into existence in a corresponding place in the Rift. Negative events like battles or especially grisly murders spawn a place haunted by the deepest and darkest horrors of the Rift. While positive events like an especially heroic act or similar things will create one of the rare sanctuaries of the Rift. Here mortals and other beings wandering the Rift can find a safe haven for a short while. As with all places in the Rift, these suffer from volatile topography and shifting surroundings as well. Unless guided by someone in the know it is highly unlikely for people to come out of the Rift in one piece.

#### Locations in the Rift

**Oneiros, the City of Sleep**: At the center of the plane, suspended in mid air, hovers a white city, Oneiros, the city of sleep. Here those who have earned a reward, dream away the time. It is also the primary home of the Apokryph in the Rift.

**Endless Woods**: A woodland haunted by those deemed unworthy to enter Oneiros. It is overrun by the nightmares of the Damned, who are forced to prey on each other for eternity. The topography and geography is permanently shifting and the Woods are shrouded in near complete darkness.

**Rift Woods**: Patches of crystalline tree like structures that grow in wooded areas on land or coral reefs under water. They can be found in the material plane and the Rift. These patches of crystalline woods mark the entrances/exits of the Rift.

Temple-caves with large square passages, rooms, and stairs underneath The Shattered Mountains. The walls and ceiling are littered with the jewels from when Gon formed the mountain range and glitter with any source of light. At the deepest point, the largest chamber serves as an audience hall with a single stone throne where Gon met with all the various minor gods he had pulled into his service. A smaller room off of this chamber served as his inner sanctum and living quarters.

A small symbiotic fungus living by eating magic. It lives in predators and eats the magic of their prey so they can feed on other animals.

### Nightwalker

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/fluduj9/)

**Description:** The Nightwalker is a symbiotic predator. In its primary form, it is similar to a wolf stalking through the utter darkness of the Endless Woods in the Rift. On occasion one or a few of these creatures might venture into the material plane but only occasionally.

If an individual mortal is able to fend off this wolf-like creature it takes gooey form and tries to bond itself to the person. The bonding process acts like sickness and kills the host through ensuing fever and auto-immune reactions. In 1 out of 10 cases however, the Nightwalker forms a symbiotic relationship with the host.

The bond with the Nightwalker endows it's with a sense of echolocation, though interpreting the new sensory input takes time and experience. The immune system of the host is also strengthened somewhat after fighting off the infection like the bonding process and their blood turns slightly acidic.

### Rift Tree

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/fluduj9/)

**Description:** Rift Trees don't have a fixed form. They can bee gnarly and weather-beaten, as high as mammoth trees or shaped like giant mushrooms. The single thing they have in common is they are all made from Rift Crystal. Plantlife tends to grow bigger and faster near Rift Trees. The curious forms the Rift Trees take in a patch of Rift Woods stem from these auras, speeding up plant growth, overlapping.

Rift Trees survive and spread by consuming matter and ambient energy and can thereby grow in any environment providing these. The presence of Rift Trees cools down the temperatures of their surroundings and makes it thereby easier for a patch of Rift Wood to spread.

Once in a time, a Tree will spawn a glowing pear-shaped Rift Fruit. If a fruit is planted alone in a field a single Rift Crystal Tree will sprout. To get rid of a Tree one has to sever all the roots of it. In a patch of Rift Wood, the roots of the Rift Crystal Trees grow together and connect to each other forming in essence one giant Rift Tree.

The Trees themselves look like described above only carved from blue or violet crystals and grow at the entrances to the Rift or in the Rift itself naturally. 

The fruit of the glows and be fashioned into a lamp, used by the Rift Keepers to guide the souls of the dead along to the afterlife.

#### The Echoing Jungle

Creator: Lyva, ( u/smcadam )

[Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flytqr2/)

The jungle across the north of the "human continent" is equatorial and warm throughout the year, though often racked by wild weather. It is largely made of huge trees sprawling 100-300 feet tall, with distinct layers of the canopy, and full of fruit, berries, herbs and edible plantlife that rapidly regrows. Thanks to the Hex of Darkness, the lower shadowy layers are almost perpetually screaming.

The lowest levels of the forest feel almost underground, a labyrinth of roots like mangrove roots which hold vast troves of fungi. The Tralinhoof, a sinuous boneless species without ears or eyes dwells here and is the primary predator, operating almost entirely on smell. Thanks to thick hide and lack of hard tissue it is very resistant to the blasts of death, and hunts with surprising ferocity.

The second level, on shelves of old matter on the roots themselves, is home to younger trees, bushes, shrubs and wrapped in twilight at best. Agile Nehreeans, six limbed spidery reptiles vault over the weak ground here and use a poisonous bite to bring prey down before outlasting them.

The low canopy is home to the most life, much of it herbivourous and navigating using vast vines, thick branches, and huge webs. Monkeys, colourful birds, flying reptiles, snakes, lizards, sloths, tree pangolins and all manner of insects as well as mortal dwellers tend to roam in this realm. The webs are creations of Lightsnares, ghostly gigantic spiders that are somewhat transparent, and actually snare webs to impress and attract mates.

The top layers of the canopy are bright and the most fruitful, though also the most volatile and dangerous on slender branches. Fireflies provide light here almost permanently, keeping the screams from sounding, and many species of sensitive bats, birds, flying serpent and tiny monkey like creatures roam here.

#### The Great Salt

Creator: Lyva and Knave, ( u/smcadam and u/Makator)

Created: [Turn 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/fllbdue/)    

Bioformed: [Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flwu3ii/)

The Great Ocean is abounding in microscopic life, particularly algae and plankton that form the basis of its food chain. Larger species like the Kymen Algae bond together into long serpent like chains, that can sometimes stretch dozens of metres long during the day.
Larger plants dominate the sea bed, with many varieties of sea weed and brine trees making food via photosynthesis and even developing fruits of sorts in order to spread. In the deeper regions, Molt Fields, large fungi claim energy from geothermal activity instead, and cover the seabed near volcanoes in a coppery thorny field.
Some species of coral and anemone can be found in the shallows, but there is not currently the variety needed for coral reefs. [I figure that's worth a seperate biome]

The vast majority of fauna in the ocean is herbivorous, with fish being the most common- species like tuna, salmon, haddock, herring, pike- along with Gildfish who stick shiny objects to their adhesive scales, Hylatlung, long sea snakes with a head at either end of their bodies, and Fareehans, gigantic fish on a scale with whales who sift and consume plankton.
Jellyfish, octopi, celaphopods, crabs and arachnids, sea scorpions, diving birds and eels survive primarily on scavenging, but are too fragile to properly hunt and kill prey.
Predators of the ocean include mertlings, feral half ape half serpent creatures, farwhals with long lance horns, shield sharks with armoured bony skulls and maws, Ripple Swarms who are small hive minded fish that sacrifice a few with every meal, sometimes causing horrific chain explosions, caprimer who are shaggy, goat fish hybrids, leonmer which are shaggy beasts covered in symbiotic weeds, and trilalungs, large winged rays with long tails who can glide above the water.

The main biohazard of the ocean is Netterkin, a large sea snake with poisonous skin, horns and a resemblance to a serpentine dragon.

A volcanic archipelago of Islands off the northern coast of Primus, created by Lyva triggering a massive eruption after a sleep. It has a vibrant and quite peaceful ecosystem with few predators built on the volcanic ash of the islands eruption. Trees growing here were tough and hardy, grass was thick, and she added peaceful creatures like kiwis, oxen, horses, goats, apes and many species of birds and snakes across the hills. In the shallow waters, large amphibious geckos as big as horses roamed, and many bright tropical insects.

### The Second Continent (Name pending)

[Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flm48zh/)

A large continent with formed by the gods Gon Gryn, Prismari, and Sunda far across the sea from the first continent. It contains an inland sea and white sand beaches on the western side with rocky coasts on the west. A mountain range runs along the eastern side, from when it was dropped there by the earth god. These mountains are rich in jewels. It has not received a proper name, but Gon calls it "Reloik'lakzek" which means "The Land of Broken Stones."

Currently barren.
