### Avatar of Rictus

/u/Horatius-Cocles

[Turn 6](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fv4ovs/endless_pantheon_turn_6/fmkgz35/)

Looks like the normal human hunter form of Rictus.

## Demigods

### Ferus

/u/Horatius-Cocles

[Turn 8](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fylavg/endless_pantheon_turn_8/fn70yyk/)

Once a mortal descendant of Rictus. He was turned into a demigod by Rictus and is his one constant companion. 

Ferus is the **demigod of memory** and bestows the miracle of memory on those he deems fit to be free mages. Who in turn can pass on this gift.

## Gods

### Azrakal

**Appearance**: A flayed man with little cloths.  
Previously: A human male with black tattoos over almost his entire body. No hair and wears simple cloths that covers very little of him.  

**Spheres**: Blood and Power

**Plans and Style**: Desires blood, lot's of blood, so much blood. Will create short lived empires that goes out to capture people for blood sacrifices. Also create Vampires. Mostly being Evil.

**Origin**: Born from a divine drop of blood.

**Further explanation**:

### The Forgotten

**Player**: /u/Abacadaren

**Spheres**: Lost things and Sentiments

**Appearance**: The Forgotten appear as a pile of discarded scrap and items, like a junkyard given life. Broken dolls, Old tools, Books with torn pages, all set in motion of one united goal: to have back what once meant so much to them.

As far as sound, The Forgotten are in a way able to speak, either through old and worn voice boxes and speakers, or the imitation of speech through the crunching and creaking of it's piles.

**Plans and Style**: The Forgotten intend to be remembered and to reduce the number of things that are lost. Their ultimate goal is, in a way, their own destruction and the removal of their furthered creation

**Origin**: Since the beginning of creation, creations have been set to the ways side. Things that once meant so much to someone can come to mean nothing in time. It's hard to remember exactly when you forgot, just that you forgot it. When The Forgotten tried to not be is anyone's guess.

**Further explanation**:

Lost things here in refers to second death style things, lost to the point no one else would be able to find/connect. This includes lost memories as well, to tie into Sentiment. The dead are a difficult case, so to set it as clear and best as possible I deal in lost things, not lost people. Spirits and souls can remember things and pass on their memories, but they do not count as remembering things themselves.

Sentiment refers to connection and emotion, like love or care (though it can be negative sentiments). The feelings one has towards a favorite stuffed animal, or the love for a family member.

### Glypha

/u/Senelaria

**Spheres**: Fear and Flesh

**Appearance**: At first glance she looks like a beautiful young woman, but the less you pay attention to her, the more you can perceive the rotting corpse underneath the exterior shell.

In her more human-looking stage of appearance, she seems to have white skin, blue eyes and black hair, while wearing a pretty, white dress.

But the more unfocused someone's look becomes on her the more the pale and blotchy skin of a corpse, the stitches keeping her rotting body parts together and the matted and filthy strands of hair shine through. As well as talons on her fingers and sharp and very hungry teeth.

**Plans and Style**: Make mortal suffer for leaving their unliving relatives to rot and die in filth.

**Origin**: Many of the mortals could not bear to kill the Unliving their loved ones on the verge of death eventually become. And so they relinquish the nearly dead in the wilds to turn into the unliving and eventually be killed by someone else. One such place is a ravine the people of this world tend to toss their dead relatives into, therefrom the unliving born of their corpses can not return to do harm.

Invariably either forced to eat each other, feed on themselves or starve a lot of magic is collected in one place, whenever more than a few of the Unliving are tossed into the ravine. From this collective suffering and magical inferno rose Glypha.

**Further explanation**: Stitching together corpse flesh to make monsters. Terrify mortals for vengeance.

### Gon Gryn, Vengeance Reborn

**Player**: /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

**Spheres**: Earth and Vengeance

**Appearance**:
A tall and muscular half-bird, half-elven man - a race known as the Gryn - with earthy brown skin covered in bright white scars. The most noticeable of these is the scar over his left eye. In place of hair, he has a crest of feathers similar in appearance to a filled-in native american chief’s headdress. These feathers fade from a bright green to a vibrant purple, with three longer feathers fading from purple to green. Green eyes flecked with purple seem to be full of intensity and he usually wears an odd smirk. Below the knees his legs become those of an eagle and end in sharp black talons. Gon doesn’t seem particularly picky about what he wears, and can often be found wearing whatever clothes are provided to him by Lyva. He does slightly favor dressing in white, but for formal occasions he dresses in a green feather robe; a memento of his “father”. In battle, he wears traditional Arakyl feathermail over a purple padded tunic. The only thing he consistently has on his person is a particular sword known as The Retaliator with its plain dark leather sheath and belt.

**Plans and Style**:
Gon has only recently ascended into godhood and the shift from a demi-god to a full fledged divine being has left a mark on him. He intends to make the best of his new powers and rather simply enjoy himself. The fetters of fate, however, may not be so easy to sever.

Being the amnesiatic form of a god from another existence, Gon has a strange mix of apathy and curiosity about him. He has a knack for understanding magic and seeks it out with enthusiasm, but tends to laze around otherwise. Outwardly friendly, Gon only truly enjoys the company of those who have become consumed by some desire; he enjoys seeing them work tirelessly towards their goals. Especially if those goals include revenge.

**Origin**:
Gon was a semi-divine being created partially from the soul fragment of a god with the same name from the Fire Realm and the memories and personality of the phoenix god, Nekalos Toneyl. His former self was apparently destroyed along with Nek’s home realm, but the god attempted to achieve resurrection in a new plane of existence by placing a fragment of his soul in the banished phoenix god. Interference from the Serpent Goddess Celastra of Space, Secrets, and Shadows caused the plan to fail and Gon’s memories were stolen and placed into a demigoddess known as Lyva. Following the recreation of his body as a demigod, the amnesiatic Gon - known as Hunger - found himself somewhat enamored with the demigoddess and her greed. Seeking refuge from a dysfunctional family relationship with Nek and his demigoddess daughter, Hylatka, Hunger decided he would stay with Lyva. Once Lyva had achieved true divinity, Hunger agreed to travel away from the world with her to seek his own divinity elsewhere.

Divinity itself, however, has a price; as he traveled with Lyva, Gon was able to modify the so-called “Toneyl Divinity Manipulation Magic” developed by Hylatka and create a divine spark by siphoning the power of souls consumed by his blade into himself. Unfortunately, this seems to have had some side effects…

### Kain marson and Prismari

**Player** /u/Rhaegar1994 

**Appearance**: kain marson: an ageing god who looks to be in his mid-thirties who a slander face with short strawberry blonde stubble along with long unkept strawberry blonde hair. He is normally always smirking . Kain wears what once was a long white robes with intricate red and black embroidery that has faded to grey and stained with void like patches. His robe is armless To show off his unique arms that appear to be made of shadows for his left and light for his right from far away, but upon closer inspection the arm made of "shadow" is truly made of storm clouds and the one made of "light is truly made of a ice cold mist.

Prismari: in his natural form Prismari look is an ever shifting blob or ball of colour. But his favourite form would be  that of an androgynous human with prismatic eyes and long rainbow hair that was about the age of eighteen. With a  cloak that has hints of colour but mostly has fade from traveling the void and is just  now black. Shockingly enough when compared to kain one could almost see a familial resemblance 

**Spheres**: storm and heroes 

**Plans and Style**: for my plans I shall be making some sort of hero based metaphysic, Along with a adventurer/ hero’s guild to possibly be my main source of worship . As for storm related stuff. I’ll likely make a metaphysic for it as well as an eternal storm or something a long the lines. 

**Origin**: kain a father whom lost his child and searched the multiverses, he finally found the lost child only to lose him as he left with a lady friend. But as luck would have it seemed prismari and lyva where separated some how well traveling the void and was rescued by his father refused to tell the child they where family but offered to help track down lyva and teach the godling a thing or two along the way

### Lyva

**Player:** /u/Smcadam       

**Spheres:** Greed and Metal     
             
**Appearance**: Lyva’s usual form is an athletic metallic goddess with curling horns amidst her long hair, and a long tail. Various panels and scales on her can open like drawers and doors to a pocket dimension where she hoards and collects… well, anything that catches her attention.                        
She normally flaunts her wealth by wearing a vast diversity of jewellery and dresses. She can shapeshift, normally changing what metal she seems composed of, or turning into a metallic asian style dragon occasionally.      

**Origin**: Lyva was originally “born” in a divine accident, from another deities greed breaking off. She’s tempered a little bit by wisdom and cunning since her birth, but fundamentally just wants everything. She quickly acquired adoptive parents, friends and lovers, and used them to ascend to full godhood, before leaving to claim her own planet.

### Oryllia, the Witch-Queen

**Player**: /u/DragoneyeCreations

**Spheres**: Hexes and Contracts

**Appearance**: Oryllia appears as a feminine figure made of violet fire, with metallic pieces adorning her like armor. Most notably, a plate with long curling horns covers her eyes like a blindfold. She wields a hammer, covered in runes.

**Plans and Style**: Oryllia, being a goddess of hexes and contracts, seeks to curse both the land and individuals through various means. She lures mortals in via contracts with her, which will nearly always end in the mortal being cursed. Primarily, she will be feared, and those who actively worship her will be those pushed to the fringes of society for being profane.

**Origins**: Oryllia was born out of the dregs of creation, the profanity, the sludge that soon became the pit from which all of her Hexes came from.

**Further Explanation**: Oryllia is an evil aligned god, so expect plenty of chaos to come from her. It’ll be a mix of simple tricks and horrendous evil.

### Rictus

**Spheres**: Law and Hunt

**Description**: Rictus generally appears in human form. The form of the man he was born as. He is of a tall but lean build and is clothed in the leather garb of a hunter. He has shoulder long, brown hair with gray streaks. He wears his hair bound back behind his head in a braid. Rictus has blue-gray eyes and a thick, full beard. His beard has the same color as his hair. The right half of his face is scarred with a big claw mark.

When he appears as the god of the hunt he often wears a green cloak. This hides his face in darkness under the cloaks hood, showing only the eyes of a predator, glowing in the dark of the hood. He also carries the full apparel of a hunter.

When he appears as the god of law he appears in armor and wearing a heavy pelt coat, carrying an executioner's sword and a law book, seemingly made from iron.

**Personality**: Rictus despite his ascension millennia ago still is mostly like the mortal man he once was. Rictus likes to look out for his people and see that they are provided for as he always has as one of the hunters of his hometown. On the other hand he is unmoving in punishing those that break the laws and that endanger the well-being of people at large.

**Background**: Rictus grew up in a small town in the mountains. Later on he had learned the trade of a hunter.

He lead the typical life of a human. He had a family. He was involved in occasional fights. He aged and slowed down, but gained in experience. He joined the elders of his hometown. Rictus learned to value the peace and sense of community, so everyone could work and live in relative prosperity. As far as was possible in a part of the world regularly plagued by raiders, vampires and ghouls. 

One day a group of wandering monks called the Logothets had marched through his hometown. Rictus listened and learned from the Logothets about the nature of reality and divinity as taught by the god called the Outsider. Mortals were normally not privy to such information

For Rictus all this discussion was too theoretical. It was a bunch of talk about the theoretical construct of the mind and the makeup of nature as a whole. Nothing that really helped him in doing his duty. Though he never really forgot what he he had heard.

The priests had wandered on disappointed. Rictus however spent much of his time contemplating the words of the Logothets, when he was out alone at night. Or sitting and waiting for the best shot on one of his hunts.

During a hunting accident where he was shot and left for dead by another hunter. He lay in the snow bleeding and feeling his live drift away. So he started praying for his family, that they were taken care of. To the gods so that he might find a good place in the afterlife. Ans so he started remembering the words of all the priests he had heard. In his hour of death he could feel the words of the Logothets from so long ago gain a new dimension. He felt something happening. A deep understanding of the world around filled him. He felt, that if he reached out he could touch things that normally were only abstracts to mortals.

In his life he had been familiar with two things, hunting and the law. He reached out for the understanding of these things he knew so well. And so he ascended.

He left his homeworld after an apocalyptic war against a god called the Shadow. And while the war was won and the Shadow vanquished the world became hostile to gods. And so he moved to a new world. Where he created humanity and built a world for mortals confronting another great evil alongside fellow divine beings called the Master of the Abyss.

Wherever Rictus turned those bent on unjust destruction and domination seemed to abound. And with the world safe once more he decided to strike out and do what he did best, bring the law to protect people and hunt down those who broke it.

### The Sorcerer

**Plans and Style:** Magic, Death and the Afterlife are linked. Expect to see as much in-game.

In the absence of his once patron deity, he himself took over the leadership of his people. And now he wanders the multiverse in search of a new world that could make an apt permanent home for his people, after their erstwhile world suffered catastrophe after catastrophe.

**Further Explanation:** The Sorcerer was once an idealistic youth trying to follow in his patron's footsteps to be a force of good. Repeated betrayals by his closest allies have made him pragmatic and weary and have shifted his focus from looking out for everyone to looking out for his people.

### Apokryph-Society

/u/Gwydion-Drys

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flua9lf/)

In mainstream Apokryph-society people are born into one of three castes. The castes are determined by the runic markings on their bodies they are born with. These marks are interpreted by the Sorcerer's priests or other representatives how to at birth.

The three castes and their societal roles are as follows:

**Philosophers** are the administrative caste. Their caste provide civic leaders, priests and scholars. They are born with magically enhanced intellect.

**Guardians** are the martial caste of the Apokryph-society. They serve as warriors, police as well as intelligence gatherers and in times of need assassins. They are born with magically enhanced speed, strength, dexterity and agility.

**Citizens** are the working caste of the Apokryph. Artists, artisans, farmers, hunters and every other profession requiring workers is part of this caste. They are born with magically enhanced endurance, patience and health.

**Mages** are born with an intuitive grasp of magic and extreme magical talent. They play a separated role in society. They are not bound by the restrictions of the castes. Their role is to teach the different castes how to harness their innate magical powers and to use their magic effectively and to keep the magical knowledge of the Apokryphs. They also are tasked with guarding Apokryph-society against magical and supernatural threats.
Innate magical are awakened in a religious ceremony wherein a small animal is sacrificed by the child to awaken their power to the Sorcerer or whichever god the Apokryph follow.

#### The Rift Keepers

These are the old Apokryphes choosing to mostly stay in the Rift. They have seen other realities and are weary of the world. But they do run through reincarnation all the same, their souls just never leave the Rift anymore, unless they are sent to collect the souls of dead people from the prime material plane.

If they do this duty they are hooded and cloaked, faced hidden behind masks. They carry lanterns of Rift Tree fruit to guide along the dead. 

Rift Keeper society largely follows the conventions laid out by the Sorcerer for the future (See nations – Magocracy).

### Blood Riders Soceity

Description: A collection of many different tribes living in the blood plains. Nomadic, herding deer and riding horses.

**Values:** The Blood Riders value strength and action. A stronger leader is far more respected then a wise or intelligent leader.  
Practical skills are also valued highly, ridding skill, leather-working, and fighting skills.

**Structures:** The blood riders are separated in to many different tribes. While each one might have it's own custom and ways, they all value strength. As such, the chief tends to be the strongest warriors in the tribe, while the title often goes from father to son, it's not unusual for it to see the chief be challenged and defeated.  
Alliances and blood feuds are common and change often, being so focused on the now and living life fully, they often do not focus on generation old grudges, if the oldest member of a tribe that remembers the original grudge dies, it often vanish with him.

**Location:** Located all over the blood plains.

Description: The Thyvians are the descendants of the Turmoiled tribe, down in the western reaches of the Blood Plains and right on the border of the Wastes of Pain.

**Culture** - Thyvians have a heavy cultural emphasis on piety, modesty, and respect towards one another. It is said that their ancestors' debaucherous behavior was the reason for the blight for their destined homeland. Common attire for men and women involve covering the entire body, with long sleeved tunics and robes that reach to their knees being a place holder outfit. Cleanliness is another focus of their culture, with one washing another as a sign of kindness.

**Religion** - The Thyvians worship a goddess called the Angel of Purity, a being said to be an exemplar of modesty and respect. Their culture practices a religious philosophy called the Rebuke. This involves a daily denial of the Witch's influence on the city, acknowledging the curses that she rains over them, and a personal declaration of respect and blessings towards others. The priests, called "the Witch's Rejecters", devote themselves to shouting among the streets, denying the Witch every morning and every night. Over their faces sit a clean slate mask with their light blue robes.

**Government** - Thyval is governed by a council called the "Fair Elders", who are voted upon by the residents of the city every 7 years. Within the central spire of the city sits the Erudite Vault, where the Elders meet to consult with each other on governing the city.

### The Apokryph

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flnbxy2/)

**Creator**: The Sorcerer, Lyva

**Amended**: [Turn 8](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fylavg/endless_pantheon_turn_8/fn3vj3d/)

**Description**: Apokryph look a lot like slightly taller than average humans. They have gray skin and night-blue eyes. Their hair colors range from white and gray over brown to black. The Apokryph are born with dark runic markings on their bodies. These markings change with the stories of their lives. 

The Sorcerer and his clergy can read these markings to determine the caste an Apokryph belongs to. As these markings change the stations and powers of an Apokryph, his or her station change in life and Apokryph-society. They also have horns to commemorate the hand of Lyva in their creation.

In their veins flows a great amount of magic extending their natural life spans up to 250 years. Additionally, they have innate magical powers making them more adept at the jobs their caste is tasked with, as Apokryph society is intended by their original creator to be a caste structure. ~~Currently, the Apokryph can however not access their life spans and innate magic as they are not yet accustomed to life in this new world~~. They have acclimatized with the Sorcerer's divine aid.

### The Jumbled

/u/Senelaria

[Turn 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlgpm/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro_act_log/fmahxwh/)

A race of mortals created by the goddess Glypha. They are produced when another jumbled cobbles together a roughly humanoid body from parts of corpses or lobbed of body parts.

### Nkarlen, the Cave Goblins

/u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW [Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flu8tjs/)

The Nkarlen are a race of four to five feet tall agile pointy-eared humanoids with crooked noses and angry looking eyes. They are extreme omnivores and will attempt to eat anything and everything. They have incredibly strong teeth and stomach acid and can therefore eat even small rocks. Created by a god of vengeance, they have a tendency to never forget even the smallest slight. When this is combined with their natural lack of sympathy, they can become hell-bent on payback. They are short-lived - their average max life span is only 40 years - but they breed like rabbits; it is common for one pair of goblins to have ten to twelve children.

They have a naturally agile and skinny physique allowing them to slip through their caves and holes quickly. Their skin is usually a mottled gray/brown, but extended exposure to light turns them green. Those goblins who never leave their caves often develop darker brown skin to the point where it is almost black. Their voices usually range from shrill to guttural with nothing in between. Goblins with normal voices are rare.

[Turn 5](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fmaxay5/)      

At the mouth of the Bakwagalis River, the city of Bakraftel grew, built on trading up river to the tribes in the Jungle and Hunting Grounds, and was one of the most multicultural cities, with humans and even Yashool visiting and sometimes staying.    






### Chalitsh

[Turn 6]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fv4ovs/endless_pantheon_turn_6/fmilp57?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

The trade route between Raha’stal and Wooxti-Kwashotl ran overland through the jungle and over the mountain range of Primus. This spawned a hospitality industry catering to merchants making the months-long journey on horseback. The Crater of Thool was one such popular stop, so was Chalitsh to the West, a Kwashotl yashool settlement at the confluence of the Bakwagalis and its tributary. They received a Black Wing governor from Shata in the year 5, and their appointments continued to come from the capital. 

### The city of Raha’stal

Over the years as the beast slayer Rahab strength and night grew so to did the village of the prismatic plains

Soon rahab had a grand ambitions. He envisioned at the base of the mountain path leading to the pilgrimage of heroes... a grand city that could one day house every hero in existence... and he would lay it’s foundation 

Using the bone of the fallen fallen dire beast he had slain he created the first of many building what would one day in the future be called the hall of heroes.... but for now it was just rahab house. His people fallowed his lead and created there own house each with unique  architecture... no two looking the same. 
It was easy to tell those who where heroes with in the city for there house almost always included the bone of dire beast in there construction and so the city of Raha’stal was born 

Over the years as Raha’stal grew other tribes of the prismatic plains cane to join the every growing city of heroes,  attracted by it tails of mighty mortals who could grab ahold of possible and protect the ones the love 

That wasn’t the only reason the population of Raha’stal boomed no one of its hero residents in the first half of its Existence named Umah the green handed discovered a great way to feed the nation with the technique of Moderate Farming(-4 for moderate farming ) with a little helping hand of Prismari even if she didn’t know and was accredited with the creation. 

Mortals also stayed for the general sense of community, lead by what where  once the zepho tribe, yet it had become the zepho guild of heroes , whom welcomed  any and all into its ranks. So long as they could uphold the ideas that all must who join must help the weaker members of the ever growing city
### City of Wooxti-Kwashotl

/u/hpllamacrft

[Turn 5]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fm7ygex?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

The city of Wooxti-Kwashotl is named for the respective human and yashool tribal confederations that it is comprised of. It is located in the jungle of Primus, along the Bakwagalis river. Seasonal flooding turns the streets into canals. Buildings are built on mounds to prevent flood damage. Dancing is central to all public ceremonies in the city. All major societies of dance are represented: Whisker, Sting, Black Wing. During the Age of Cities its major industries were bronze working and bumblebird jelly harvesting. During this age the city had much contact with Thool's Crater and Raha'stal. 

### The City on the Well

The Worshipers of Mair have built a pale reflection of the Temple of Life, and they have begun to build a city around it. This City's Name is Gwanyin. Immigrants were initially drawn to the City by the promise of Life Essence. They were made to stay within the city by the easy access to life-saving Essence, and the comforts born of the City's rapidly advancing technology.

#### Civil Defense
All men and women who live within the walls of Gwanyin are trained in the Basic Arts of War. 

The City supplies each person with a Spear, a Shield, a bow, and basic armor. Craftsmen and other wealthy individuals are expected to outfit themselves in more exceptional equipment. Professional Soldiers are selected from members of the Labor Class who show exceptional aptitude at War, and Officers are promoted form their ranks. Professional Soldiers are given equipment suited to their role, and spend their peace-time as a Guard-Force within the city.

Everyone old enough to train is expected, and scheduled, to report to one of the City's Mustering Grounds once a week. These Courtyards are located next to the Temple of Life, and they are large enough for a force of men to practice moving in formation, combat in formation, and then split off for one-on-one sparring. The practice is overseen by a member of the Order of War, who is enjoying a day off from *their* training to spread their wisdom to lesser warriors.

In the event of the City coming under attack, every man and woman within its walls is capable of joining the defense. Only Artisans, such as Blacksmiths and Architects, are expected to remain off the walls in such an event. Their *knowledge* and skill is seen as too valuable to risk in battle.

#### The Essence Economy
Just as the City is physically centered on the Well of Life, its Economy is similarly centered upon the Life Essence drawn from the Well.

The Well is sheltered in the Temple of Life, a Fortress-Temple dedicated to Mair. It is a Sacred Place to the Men of Dernas, and the center of their City-State's Governance. It is a place of Healing, of Stockpiling Food against famine, and the last line of defense against those who seek to conquer The Well of Life. The Temple of Life is home to *two* Holy Orders. 

> **The Orders of the Temple**
>
> The Order of Life is the Peaceful side of the Temple. The Order's most important duty is drawing Life Essence from the Well of Life. They administer the Essence to the Sick and Wounded of Dernas, and they throw the bodies of those about to die *into* the well to avoid the rise of Deathless. Their least public, but most *significant*, duty is as the City's Administrative Class. They maintain the city's genealogical records, sign off on work orders, and see to it that the city's craftsmen and laborers are supplied with raw materials.
>
> The Order of War is a brotherhood of Warriors, the finest in Amalah. There are rarely more than fifty members of the Order living within the Temple at any given time. They are given a cup of Life Essence to drink every morning. They then spend the majority of their day *training* for war. Their Training Routine is intense enough that it would kill any mortal man, and includes sparring with sharpened weapons and *barely* pulling strikes. The Order's daily dosage of Life Essence allows their bodies to push through the agonizing trials, and recover in time to do it again the next day. They are known for their *calmness* in battle, for their training has rid them of the fear of death and pain. They battle in silence, calmly and efficiently slaughtering their enemies.

The Order of Life trades with the City-State's Farmers and Tribal Hunters, exchanging Life Essence for food. They also trade the Essence for other resources, such as raw metals and timber, necessary to fuel the city's construction, expansion, and maintenance. A vial of the Essence can be the difference between life and death for a hunter, for it can allow the body to recover from otherwise deadly wounds. It is even more valuable to a Farmer, who can sprinkle the Essence upon their fields and multiply their crop four-fold.

The City's Residents, Specialists and Laborers alike, are cared for by the Temple. Their Food and Supplies are procured by the Temple, secured in Warehouses and allocated in accordance with the Priests' Holy Wisdom. The city is kept in a steady state of expansion. New Housing, Workshops, Warehouses, and *Walls* are constantly being constructed.

The City's Purpose is to hold the Well of Life, and as such the City's Industry is focused upon fueling its war machine. Making advancements in Metallurgy and Craftsmanship win men a place in Song and *Legend* as surely as martial prowess, and Smiths and Bowyers are second only to Warriors in prestige. Architects and Engineers are the next most prestigious professions, for their minds give birth to new fortifications, massive weapons, and other defenses for the Well of Life.

#### The Roads to Gwanyin

Gwanyin's Weakness was also one of its defensive strengths. It was nestled in a Volcanic Caldera... at the top of a very tall Mountian. There were only a handful of roads that could lead a man to the Silroin Caldera, and the City of Gwanyin at its center. Most of them were ancient affairs, unpaved but still *relatively* passable, which circled the mountain's edges and cut through natural caverns on their way up into the caldera. The rest were natural paths. 

This posed a slight *problem* as commerce began to flow up the sides of the mountain. Wear and tear on the paths had caused them to *degrade* over time. If nothing was done, the roads would eventually turn to rubble... and passage would be restricted to the natural paths. Those would grow congested, and in time they would wear away... and rock-slides and avalanches would become serious problems. Repairing and reinforcing the roads was a colossal task for the people of Gwanyin... but it became a priority.

In the meantime, something had to be done to keep the roads open. The solution... was a rough one. Travel up and down the mountain was heavily controlled. The Order of Life's Bureaucrat-Priests worked to figure out *who* should walk *which* road to reach Gwanyin. They took careful accounting of the *weight* of those who traveled, and tried to do their best to send them on paths that could bear them.

The Systems they developed would remain even after the roads were repaired... and would be used to limit damage to the roads and keep the maintenance budget under control.

#### Subject Villages

Gwanyin is not the only settlement in the Silroin Caldera. It has many smaller neighbors, a series of Farming Villages. The City holds sway over these Villages through its two great resources: Life Essence and Warriors.

The City is dependent upon the Villages for food, and it protects them *fiercely*. Any invading force that seeks to raid a Caldera Village is inviting vengeance from Gwanyin. When word of an attack reaches the City, a force of well-trained and well-disciplined soldiers will inevitably be dispatched... generally with a party of five members of the Order of War attached to them.

Likewise, the Villages are dependent upon Gwanyin for the Life Essence. Mixing Life-Essence into the water that irrigates their crops is the *foundation* of the Villagers' rampant success. They trade roughly a quarter of their crop at harvest time, and in exchange the Order of Life will supply them with Life Essence in the Spring. This ensures that their crops are bountiful, allowing them to trade freely with tribes wise enough to *trade* rather than *raid*. 

### Enkenea

Home to a large community of Gon's Goblin priests, known as the Ranos.

Other settlements/cities include:

### Herding the Masses - The Holy City of Thyval

The Turmoiled of the Red Plains began constructing a citadel, situated near the border of the Wastes, where their ancestors witnessed the very curse that robbed them of their holy land. However, they were near enough that such a city could become their new holy land in its own right.

And so, the Holy City of Thyval was born.

Culture - Thyvians have a heavy cultural emphasis on piety, modesty, and respect towards one another. It is said that their ancestors' debaucherous behavior was the reason for the blight for their destined homeland. Common attire for men and women involve covering the entire body, with long sleeved tunics and robes that reach to their knees being a place holder outfit. Cleanliness is another focus of their culture, with one washing another as a sign of kindness.

Religion - The Thyvians worship a god called the Angel of Purity, a being said to be an exemplar of modesty and respect. Their culture practices a religious philosophy called the Rebuke. This involves a daily denial of the Witch's influence on the city, acknowledging the curses that she rains over them, and a personal declaration of respect and blessings towards others. The priests, called "the Witch's Rejecters", devote themselves to shouting among the streets, denying the Witch every morning and every night. Over their faces sit a clean slate mask with their light blue robes.

Government - Thyval is governed by a council called the "Fair Elders", who are voted upon by the residents of the city every 7 years. Within the central spire of the city sits the Erudite Vault, where the Elders meet to consult with each other on governing the city.

### Lyvkerel, Holy City of Metal

### The Magocracy

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flua9lf/)

The Magocracy may in future live up to its potential and become the grand nation of magic. But for now they are not more than a primitive tribe with a primitive village led by a shaman. And the caste system only crudely observed.

Though following the Sorcerer's plans the Apokryphes will in time transform their society into the Magocracy, building a nation on the material plane akin to the society of Apokryphs as established in the Rift.

With their caste society having religious and cultural meaning. No caste is higher than another in social standing. They just serve as crude way to determine one's vocation in life. Administration, sciences and works of pure intellect are done by the Philosophers. The Guardians are the defenders of the nation and work in every way the defense of the nation requires from military service and training to espionage and other less unsavory practices of war and politics. The citizens do the day to day work. Although money plays never a large role in the nation. Money is mostly frowned upon and only used to trade with foreigners.. The mages are a casteless part of society involved in all workings their help and presence is needed.

People carry a private name for personal use and a public use-name. People who distinguish themslves are given titles by the leaders of society like The Guardian or The Warrior.

As in the Rift the nation is supposed to be governed by the Inner Council. Where all Apokryphes castes and all cities contribute a councilor. The Circle is lead by the First Councilor whose job it is to break ties in votes. The Circle is advised by the mages

While all forms of art are a trade for the Citizen case the pursuit of art and knowledge in their freetime is encouraged. The masks nearly all citizens wear not only carry marks of their station in society, but can also be customized to a degree and are the prime opportunity for Apokryphs to show their artistic skills.

The nations of the Apokryphs have in many worlds left their mark by being the biggest exporters of enchanted wares and no one says they can not do it again.

#### Epoidos and The White Gates

/u/Gwydion-Drys

[Turn 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fsee67/endless_pantheon_turn_4/fm5s8wo/)

On the Kiln islands there is a patch of Rift Wood. It's Rift Trees have been carved into the shape of a gateway. On the hinges of this gateway are two heavy white gates. These gates are the only entrance from the prime material plane to the Sleeping City in the Rift.

So it should not come as a surprise that around these gates a settlement of Apokryphs have collected. Worshipping the Sorcerer they founded the city of Epoidos here to guard these gates to the afterlife.

While there is not yet much magic to study the Sorcerer intended for this town to become the worlds premiere center of magical learning. The town where the knowledge of everything magical in this world is kept. A veritable holy land of the Sorcerer, where those wanting to learn his teaching can flock together.

### Sanctuary

The Hunting Grounds were the ancestral home of humanity. Made by Rictus and traveled by his people under the guidance of the Iron Judges it was home to many nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes of humans, using the magical arrows Rictus had given their forefathers to hunt.

Their is however one town where the Iron Judges meet to deliberate on recent events, religious matters and tribal business. The place is called Sanctuary. Where outside the tribes often squabble over the best places to hunt, sources of water or the best trees to make arrows from in Sanctuary the Iron Law reigns supreme and no one dares to break the law given to humanity by their creator and patron Rictus.

It is no one wonder then that the center of worship for Rictus is also Sanctuary. The people of Sanctuary try to live by the Iron Law and try to educate visitors on the Iron Law in accordance with the teachings of Rictus. The town of Sanctury is the holy land of Rictus.

### The Crow

/u/Senelaria

[Turn 8](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fylavg/endless_pantheon_turn_8/fn9orgy/)

The Crow is an artifact, that looks like a child even to gods. It was made to serve as protector and play companion and caretaker for Yana, the daughter of Lyva. 

Crow in its normal state is like a very dim-witted young child in intellect and appearance. But if Yana is threatened the monster inside comes out. 

Inside Crow is an old rusty metal scarecrow with eyes of fire who will attack anything with malicious intent towards Yana. It has iron teeth and claws and is supernaturally fast, strong and can blend in with the surroundings, if not directly looked at.

The Crow is also fireproof.

### Iron Codex of Yrdin

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 8](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fylavg/endless_pantheon_turn_8/fn3vj3d/)

A Codex of the Iron Law once owned by Yrdin the hero. Allows to summon his slumbering heroic spirit and imparting a worthy souls with wisdom of the powers of an Iron Judge. (2 acts)

### The Retaliator

**Creator**: ??? ( /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW ) 

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flg98lz/)

**Description**: 
A feather shaped blade that has turned to pitch black obsidian after being used in a ritual to ascend to godhood. A fuller ran the length of the blade and formed what would have been the stem of the feather. The shining brass or gold guard was formed in the shape of wings, the handle wrapped in a what had become rough blackened leather in a criss-cross fasion, and the pommel was in the shape of a bird's head with three eyes. Each eye was a different gemstone; emerald, ruby, and diamond.

The Retaliator was sword of divine creation that Gon brought along with him from another world. Having lost its old patron and having being used as a catalyst to create Gon's spark of divinity, it had been rendered powerless and immaterial.

**Blessings**: 0 (The blade exists as a part of Gon's divine form only, for now.)

### Fidelity

**Creator**: Yashqal(/u/hpllamacrft)

**Created**: [Turn 1]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flhz5pr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**Description**: The true essence of all things, which can be mimicked to induce transformation. 

Every thing has a core essence. This essence can be perceived by the outward characteristics of a thing. Creatures can change their own core essence by dancing in a way that mimics the core essence of another thing. This is called showing fidelity. By showing fidelity to a thing one adopts a thing’s outward characteristics to a limited degree.
For example, a mortal looking to become tougher may show fidelity to a boulder. From observing the boulder they invent a boulder dance that captures the essence of boulders. Then the mortal practices this boulder dance for years; his skin grows tough and he is able to withstand strikes with greater resistance. In the same way, a fox dance may make someone stealthier, the gazelle dance may make someone more beautiful, the fruit dance may make someone more fertile.

### Knitting Flesh

/u/Senelaria

[Turn 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlgpm/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro_act_log/fmahxwh/)

Among mortals only the jumbled can make use of the powers this metaphysic bestows. It allows a jumbled to take body parts cut off of another person or corpse and sew them together. A living person can so be given use of a replacement limb if they lost their own.

If a jumbled sews together a roughly humanoid form from corpse or body parts the resulting body comes alive as a jumbled themself. The jumbled live a relatively normal mortal life with a normal life span, the only caveat being they can only reproduce by knitting together a new jumbled. Biologically these new jumbled can however perform any other task a normal human, goblin or whater flesh was used in their creation, can. (Even sex.)

### Legends of the heroes

**Creator**: Kain  & prismari 

**created**: [turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgnymn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

**The Law**: Mortals who embrace their Legend shall grow stronger as it grows, but Legends never die.

**Explanation**: When a Non-Incarnate Mortal has the desire to change the world, they open themselves up to the Legends of the heroes . Specifically, they open up the possibility to build their Personal heroic Legend. This turns them into a Heroic Mortal. Heroic Mortals do not need to be "Good" or "Evil," they only need the desire to make a change in the world.

Heroic Mortals grow their Legend by growing their reputation (or fame) in the eyes of other mortals. However, Legend will only grow if you actually did what people think you did. You can't just claim credit for what other people do. Your Legend will not grow if you are anonymous either, people need a name to attach to your deeds in order for you to gain Legend. That name can be a pseudonym, though.
Heroic Mortals are able to draw upon their Legend to fuel greater deeds. Those with powerful Legends will be able to achieve superhuman feats, although they will never get strong enough to solo a Demigod. This can become a self-reinforcing feedback loop of Greater Powers leading to Greater Deeds leading to Greater Powers.
There is a cost to Heroism. Heroes Never traditionally Die, but are instead consumed by their Legend. Sure there body may pass with a magical explosion which depending on the size of the legend may be larger and become a unliving but yet A small portion of Their souls will never pass on to an Afterlife, but will instead linger as a portion of their Legend, In the form of an artifact that can gift future heroes with a bit of past heroes abilities. These artifacts cost players at the least 2 acts 


### Life after Death

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgku2r/)

**Creator**: The Sorcerer

**Amended**: -

**Description**: In accordance with the laws of thermodynamics energy can not be created or destroyed only displaced and transformed. The energy of life permeating mortal bodies does not fade with death.

In animals the energy once keeping them alive turns into magical energy. The one and only source for everything magical. This magical energy has only a very short halflife and dissipates into the surrounding world as light and heat energy.

Once a mortal has reached the end of his/her/its natural life span or is killed in another way the soul is separated from the body. The body however does not die off. It is transformed into a so called “Unliving”.

The Unliving are feral beings not unlike zombies, but instead of rotting they are functionally alive bodies without minds beyond those of primitive animals only set on sating their base desires like food, drink and procreation.

If an Unliving is killed its animating force turns into magical energy as well. The transformation from magical energy to heat and light occurs in seconds. An Unliving explodes with the force of a grenade and the smaller the animal the less force/ magic is released.

To kill an Unliving its brain needs to be destroyed. Any parts attached to the head stay active.

Unclaimed souls and those claimed by the Sorcerer are after death escorted to the afterlife in the “Rift”, the Sorcerer's plane, by the mortals inhabiting the Rift and only those inhabiting the Rift.

The Unliving yearn to sate all their animal desires including food, sleep and sex at all costs. They are however biologically mortal and produce mortal children.

### Power of Blood

/u/Plintstorm 

[Turn 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flnix1j/)

**Description:** Power rest in blood, more powerful people have more powerful blood. Heroes, Kings and other figures of power and authority have power in their blood, making them physically more powerful.  
Power is just not strength, but also a general meaning of power. Kings blood makes for good king in several aspect.  
Blood can also be applied to people and objects to increase their power temporarily.

### The Thirteen Hexes

**Creator**: Oryllia(/u/DragoneyeCreations)

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flhf0w8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**Description**: ~~A set of thirteen distinct blights upon the world, forged by the primordial dregs of creation.~~

The Hexes were undone by Oryllia, after an immense crisis of guilt and an encounter with Lyva.

#### ~~Hex 1 - The Soil Shrieks~~

~~Every time a region of the world is covered in darkness, the air is filled with bloodcurdling screams.~~

### Tsukumogami, or Familial Bonding

**Creator**: /u/Abacadaren

**Created**: [Turn 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flte821/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=GodhoodWB&utm_content=t1_flsx2v4)

**Description**: Items gain power based off the time that it spends with its owner who gives special care and attention to it (Whether positive or negative). Items can be passed on to family members which regress the years to halfway through the previous phase (Excluding the final phase). For all intents and purposes aside from worship, items that have bonded to the 100+ years phase are mortals.

Years Owned | Power
:--|:--:
1-32| Easier/Harder maintenance, can make small jumps/jerks of motion, Aware of who owns it
33-66| Finer control of self, can provide the feeling of an emotion to its owner, able to "see" up to 5 ft away (Blindsight 5 ft), and weak special abilities based off of what the item is (Mirror can control its reflection, cooking knife can auto-chop ingredients as long as its held, stuffed animals can make animal noises)
67-99| Can do multiple actions in a row, Can provide concepts/ideas to owner, Blindsight 10 ft, special abilities are strengthened
100+| Full control of self like any person would have control over their body, Sentient personality based off of experience and owner(s), able to communicate with those around it, Blindsight 20 ft, Can be passed on to family or friends without any regression of power. Item never losses its sentience or ability unless destroyed

Of note, hero artifacts are spawned from a soul and as such aren't fully inanimate objects to be affected by this metaphysics, but things like artifacts can be

### Theurgy - Cantrips

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fm8mb06/)

These spells can be cast by anyone. Up to three times per day any combination of these cantrips can be used. They are influenced by the gods and their domains and allows mortals to channel magical power in an imitation of divine power for the following purposes:

God | Cantrip
:--|:--|
|**Azrakal** (Blood &amp; Power)|Consume blood for short boost of endurance.|
|**Dawri** (Fate &amp; Time)|Divination on planned events can give a feeling about it going right or wrong.|
|**The Forgotten** (Lost Things &amp; Sentiments)|Mend items with sentimental value.|
|**Glypha** (Fear &amp; Flesh)|Evoke fear by illusion of rotten flesh.|
|**Gon Gryn** (Earth &amp; Vengeance)|Create small pit trap.|
|**Kain Marson &amp; Prismari** (Storm &amp; Heroes)|Fortify yourself against bad weather.|
|**Lyva** (Metal &amp; Greed)|Detect precious metals in vicinity.|
|**Mair** (Life &amp; War)|Mend minor cuts and bruises.|
|**Malaphet** (Stars &amp; Minds)|Navigate via stars.|
|**Oryllia** (Hexes &amp; Contracts)|Make a curse mark appear on someone who broke a contract.|
|**Rictus** (Law &amp; Hunt)|Detect stolen goods of yours.|
|**The Salty Knave** (Sea &amp; Theft)|Evoke sounds, smells or feelings of the ocean.|
|**Sarah** (Darkness &amp; Protection)|Shroud yourself in darkness if threatened.|
|**Shilo** (Agriculture &amp; Competition)|Discern best way to grow crops better than rival of choice.|
|**The Sorcerer** (Magic &amp; Death)|Delay the decay of free magical energies into light and heat.|
|**Sunda** (Animals &amp; Wilds)|Screen surroundings for animal tracks or food sources.|
|**Thool** (Seasons &amp; Trees)|Disappear/ hide between trees.|
|**Yashqal** (Dance &amp; Mimicry)|Mimic someone's voice or a sound.|

(As magical power is channeled there still needs to be killed something before use of a cantrip or the caster needs a store of magical power of some kind.

## Miracles

### The Free Mages

/u/Horatius-Cocles

[Turn 8](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fylavg/endless_pantheon_turn_8/fn70yyk/)

By training their minds in special way the people known as Free Mages have special capabilities, by giving them enhanced mastery over their memories.

What this means is, if they see or experience a specific move set, like a fighting style, carpentry or free climbing they can replicate these moves from memory. As memories are imperfect and often colored by the individuals that have them, this process is not perfect. Only allowing for weaker versions of whatever they copy from their memories. It doesn't make them masters at any particular skill they replicate, but allows them to be skilled at many things.

This even extends to magic. They can summon magic spells they remember at will into the real world. Thereby replicating said magic. As stated above memories of mortals aren't perfect, so the magic produced is often times less powerful than its original version. And the more complex the magic the more unlikely it is a free mage will be able to replicate it to a more than mediocore success.

Since Free Mages only copy the memorized effect of a spell, their castings don't share the same limitations as those of the original magic like set metaphysics or rituals required. The caster is limited only by the number of spells he has witnessed and thereby at his command and his own endurance.

The demigod Ferus teaches new free mages, who can pass on the knowledge of how to become a free mage to an apprentice.

### The Iron Law

/u/Horatius-Cocles 

[Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgku2r/)

At any time there are a number of individuals (number will grow with time and a bigger population), chosen by Radamanthys the minor god of judges. 

People found worthy by Radamanthys gain knowledge of the law as laid down in Rictus' Iron Codex. Most people can only use the powers of an Iron Judge to enforce the Iron Law as laid down in the Iron Codex.

But due to an unexpected interference between the blood metaphysic making people more powerful and the strange metaphysics of this new world, Iron Judges who gain positions as nobles, kings, high government officials, etc gain the ability to interpret the Iron Law more flexible or in very rare cases to choose another altogether different set of laws of their own choosing to enforce.

While most people chosen by Radamanthys will stay their course and stick to the Iron Law, the power may corrupt some few individuals who use their powers not in the service of the Iron Law, but for themselves or their chosen codices of law. It falls to the Iron Inquisitors to root out these corrupt judges.

Iron Inquisitors are tasked with special duties by the god Rictus, among the most important is the neutralizing of renegade Iron Judges, who don't use their powers for justice and in unethical ways.

The Iron Judges, in turn, are bound to the strict nature of the Iron Law and are provided with knowledge of how to interpret the Law correctly and in extension how to give and render judgment correctly. After an impartial investigation of course. If a judge fails to comply with this, he is stripped of his rank and judged by an Iron Inquisitor accordingly to the Iron Law and replaced by an individual found worthy to serve. The ousted former judge then loses all his powers.

The Law is independent thereby subject to no one and to be obeyed by all. The Judges by extensions are only subject to the Iron Law, and while they may choose to worship any god and follow any mortal individual they desire, they still have to render judgment even of their king if the Iron Law demands it. 

By extension, the Judges are not susceptible to being mind-controlled or influenced even by the divine. While a god can still smite a judge, if they wish to do so, they can not in any other way interfere with a judge's work. The free will and action of a judge can NOT be tampered with under any circumstances in as far as it pertains to his duties as an Iron Judge. Their free and honest judgment in accordance with the Iron Law is a judge's first duty.

While in an ideal world everyone would live by the rule of law, many people or their gods don't support the Iron Law [yet].

The Law and its judges can render judgment on anyone who breaks the Iron Law. To do this the Judges are given the power to make reality around them conform to the Iron Law.
For example, if the Iron Law forbids the carrying of weapons, the presence of an Iron Judge would make it impossible to bear arms. Anyone carrying a weapon would find themselves unable to lift or draw the weapon. The Iron Judge would then proceed to the judgment and the meting out of punishment for the transgression of bearing arms. For a judges powers to take effect they need to proclaim a verdict by any reasonable form of communication, meaning even writing and sign language would work.

To use this power however an Iron Judge has to know one of the Iron Laws is broken. He has to be near the infraction to fix it and using this power is taxing. The greater the change to reality, the greater the fatigue a judge incurs after using this power. This can even lead to death.

However, if the cause of an infraction is supernatural the power can be fueled by energies of the supernatural entity/ magic that said infraction is coming from, not taxing the judge as much in using their power.

The only circumstance under which judgment/ punishment can be avoided to be given by an Iron Judge is to prevent greater and heavier consequences than letting crime go unpunished.

Lastly fast and swift action is often necessary. If there is a threat too big to be handled by Iron Judges or to the Iron Law itself an Iron Inquisitor can be called. Iron Inquisitors carry all the powers of the Iron Judges are for the duration of their missions however exempt from judgment themselves. They can, however, be judged after their missions are finished and their status as Iron Inquisitors revoked.

In a state of extreme emergency, where the Law isn't only threatened but can be considered non-existent because of the reigning disorder. An Iron Inquisitor can name Lawbringers.

Lawbringers are endowed with the power to actively bend reality to bring order into chaos. Where the Iron Judges can only bend reality to conform to law, a Lawbringer can bend reality to what it should be in the Lawbringer's eyes.

These powers can be revoked by an Iron Inquisitor or withdrawn by the miracle itself, if grossly misused.

The strain put on Lawbringers is the same or even greater as that put on Judges, when they bend reality.

### Waidmänner

/u/Horatius-Cocles 

[Turn 5](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fmbyy5j/)

Warriors serving as the armed wing of Order of Iron Judges to enforce the law and as agents to the demigod Ferus, the Waidmänner receive their power by being chosen to serve by the Iron Judges or Ferus. The Waidmänner are gifted the abilities to be deadly hunters and warriors to boot.

- Hunting Intuition: The Waidmann possesses extraordinary instincts, allowing them supernatural tracking abilities and more accurate senses. Their senses are in fact so sharp: If they can see, hear, smell or in any other way perceive their target, they can deduce knowledge about their target like is the target human, what age, injuries and weakness to exploit, is the target hostile or a danger.

- Stealth Tactics: The Waidmann is very knowledgeable in stealth and hunting tactics and master them to perfection. Beyond that someone guilty of breaking the Iron Law has a harder time detecting the Waidmann, to aid in the offenders apprehension or to more easily serve justice. 

- Weaponsmastery: The Waidmann is a master in the use of their hunting implements. It doesn't matter if bow, cannon, spear or knife. The Waidmann knows instinctively how to use whatever tool is at hand to capture or incapacitate his chosen prey.

- Trophies: Any Waidmann can perform this hunting ritual. In which he has to slay prey shown to him in a vision. The Hunt has to be undertaken without resources or any form of supernatural or divine powers and only things or powers acquired during the quest can be used for the hunt. If the quest is completed successfully the Waidmann gains some of the power of his prey. This effect is accumulative.

 So an experienced Waidmann, who has gone though the ritual several times, will have a number of powers like night vision, or the enhanced senses and strength of an animal, or things as straightforward as retractable claws. Any new cycle however will be more difficult than the last.

### Arrow Spells

/u/Horatius-Cocles 

[Turn 5](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fmbyy5j/)

- Armor Piercer: An arrow with increased piercing power versus armor or big beasts.

- Delayed Arrow: Freezes in the air when shot and only takes flight after a delay, allowing the archer to hide or change positions.

- Splitting Arrow: Splits into 3 in flight and hits target thrice.


### Blood Empowerment

/u/Plintstorm 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fm7wgzs/)

**Description:** By killing a creature, be it man or beast, one can then drink it's blood in a magical ritual to gain it's power.  
While only a small amount of it's total power is gained, it is permanent and can be repeated.

### Blood Storage

/u/Plintstorm 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flxvou2/)

**Description:** Magic used to store magics in blood. Stores magic for 1 year and 1 day.

### Magic Arrows

/u/Horatius-Cocles 

[Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flnbg3y/)

Magical Arrows who can absorb magical energies upon killing something, so it does not explode. Magical energy is stored in the arrow until discharged. This is a secret magic and does not become general knowledge. Can only be learned by bargaining with Rictus or buying it directly for 3 acts + 2 acts for secrecy.

### The Mindburn spell

As the Vazari experimented with their mental ability to dominate others, they found that, if magic was used to amplify their attempt at domination, it could not only dominate a person, but burn out any personal memories that the target possessed while leaving the majority of what made them useful, such as the knowledge of how to craft things or what type of foods where toxic, while leaving them unable to remember who even their closest friends or family.

The Vazari turned to using this spell as a way to punish their more heinous criminals whose skills were valuable or rare, enough so that consigning them to unliving status outweighed the benefit of imposing more lethal punishments. In effect this spell could only be used legally after a fair trial was conducted by the judging of their peers and after the ritual was completed, the criminal was treated as a reborn person, given a new name and adopted or auctioned off into a family or other tribe that desired their skills so that the victims of the crimes would not have to deal with seeing the perpetrator day in and day out.
### Petrification Magic

/u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

[Turn 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fmb4yly/)

This required the caster to take in the magic from an unliving creature who had been put down and redirect that energy to their target.

Petrification magic was not instant and could only be used from a short distance, but the living/unliving would slowly turn to stone from the point that the magic was directed to, until they had been rendered into nothing more than a statue. This spell does not permit this to be undone. To prevent becoming a statue, one must rid themselves of all of the parts that have started to turn to stone.

### The Rift

**Creator**: The Sorcerer

**Amended**: -

**Description**: The Sorcerer's very own plane between worlds. For the souls of the dead it functions as an afterlife for the Apokryph it is their home dimension. 

The Rift is a volatile, shifting and twisted mirror version of the material world. It grows and changes as the material plane does. The Rift is a place born of Magic and Death. The **Endless Woods** make up the majority of the plane. It is steeped in eternal darkness. The terrain is unreliable and distances change at will. Where an hour ago a river was flowing now a mountain could be standing.

At the center of the plane, suspended in mid air instead of a sun hovers a white city, **Oneiros**, the city of sleep.

Three kinds of dead souls are found in the Rift:

- The first are souls with no other afterlife to go to.

- The second are the faithful of the Sorcerer.

- The third are the souls of the dead Apokryph, waiting for reincarnation.

The first two kinds are judged and either allowed entrance to Oneiros, where they can sleep and dream away the time. 

If they are found unworthy they are tossed into the Endless Woods where they are forced to prey on each for eternity, while their worst nightmares take shape and torment all of them equally.

The third kind live among their living kin, but are unable to leave the Rift.

Beyond that the Rift connects to all Rift Woods of the material world. Mortals, who know how and dare to enter, will be able to go to this plane through the Rift Woods. Then they can wander the Rift until they reach a place connecting to a different patch of Rift Wood and return through there to the material plane or they find the hidden way to Oneiros, where they can try to reach their dead loved ones.

While people not privy to the secrets of mastering the Rift Woods and the Rift will be in danger of stumbling blind into this plane and never come back. Because they run afoul of the dangers of the Endless Woods, wandering through the Rift until they die. Or they stumble back into the mortal world in a random patch of Rift Wood, possibly on the opposite side of the world, driven mad by the horrors of the Endless Woods. Creatures and plants can make their way around the world in this way as well and wander into the Rift, where they become inhabitants of the Rift itself. 

Upon significant events in the material world, like the founding of an important city, a battle or the creation of an especially holy sight etc., a similar location will come into existence in a corresponding place in the Rift. Negative events like battles or especially grisly murders spawn a place haunted by the deepest and darkest horrors of the Rift. While positive events like an especially heroic act or similar things will create one of the rare sanctuaries of the Rift. Here mortals and other beings wandering the Rift can find a safe haven for a short while. As with all places in the Rift, these suffer from volatile topography and shifting surroundings as well. Unless guided by someone in the know it is highly unlikely for people to come out of the Rift in one piece.

#### Locations in the Rift

**Oneiros, the City of Sleep**: At the center of the plane, suspended in mid air, hovers a white city, Oneiros, the city of sleep. Here those who have earned a reward, dream away the time. It is also the primary home of the Apokryph in the Rift.

**Endless Woods**: A woodland haunted by those deemed unworthy to enter Oneiros. It is overrun by the nightmares of the Damned, who are forced to prey on each other for eternity. The topography and geography is permanently shifting and the Woods are shrouded in near complete darkness.

**Rift Woods**: Patches of crystalline tree like structures that grow in wooded areas on land or coral reefs under water. They can be found in the material plane and the Rift. These patches of crystalline woods mark the entrances/exits of the Rift.

### The Sorcerer's Runes

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fm8mb06/)

Runic markings taught to mortals by the Sorcerer. If fed with magical energy by killing something of by a store the runes can be charged and used to their magical purposes until depleted. At which point they need to be recharged again.

- Rune Pyxos: Putting it on an object makes it more durable for a while. While a living thing can carry heavier loads.

- Rune Akribeia: Putting it on an object this enchantment makes a tool or weapon exert more force when used. While it heightens someones precision with a tool or weapon if put on a living thing. 

- Rune Fora: Putting it on a living thing this spell boosts its stamina. For missiles and vehicles it boosts their speed.

#### Secret Runes

##### Necromancy

/u/Gwydion-Drys

[Turn 7](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fwp5rk/endless_pantheon_turn_7/fmvpcz7/)

The art of communing with the spirits of the dead and employ them for the mages ends and means, either by traveling to the Rift and dealing with them directly, or by summoning them into the prime material plane by use of magical runes and rituals. There are two ways to cast any spell of necromancy.

- Katabasis

The act of traveling the Rift and seeking out the dead is fraught with peril, however necromancers undertaking this risk will find the dead much more willing to deal with them and following their commands. The spirits of the dead the necromancer wishes to employ then accompany the necromancer to the prime material plane. To allow them to do such their way needs to be paid by magical energies. In essence the mage visits the ghost and accompanies him to do his magical task.

- Summoning

Under the use of runes taught by the Sorcerer and consumption of magical energies a ghost can be raised straight from the Rift. However planar travel tends to muddle the mind, even of the dead, so any answers ghosts summoned this way are to be taken with a grain of salt and they may object to be torn out of the afterlife and spells they are employed for may be less potent.

###### Purposes

The use of necromancy serves three primary purposes: the acquisition of knowledge, the conjuration of illusions and the manipulation of the will of the living.

- Knowledge: The dead can trade knowledge after death or share knowledge they possessed in life. However after a year and a day in the Rift their minds start to forget and the knowledge they can provide dwindles. (3 acts for spells + 2 for secret)

- Illusion:   Depending on if the necromancer wants to show people good or bad events in an illusion, a soul is summoned either from the Sleeping City or the Endless Woods. The blessed souls from Oneiros, the Sleeping City can show others the dreams dreamt by the dead, resulting in an enjoyable illusion. Damned souls from the Endless Woods share their nightmares and horrors with people. (3 acts for spells + 2 for secret)

- Manipulation of Will: A necromancer can not outright mind control a person. However by summoning the ghosts of the Rift a sort of post-hypnotic suggestion can be laid on people, by ghosts whispering into people's ears and minds ideas, feelings or courses of action of the necromancer's will.

The use of necromancy serves three primary purposes: the acquisition of knowledge, the conjuration of illusions and the manipulation of the will of the living.

- Knowledge: The dead can trade knowledge after death or share knowledge they possessed in life. However after a year and a day in the Rift their minds start to forget and the knowledge they can provide dwindles. (3 acts for spells + 2 for secret)

- Illusion:   Depending on if the necromancer wants to show people good or bad events in an illusion, a soul is summoned either from the Sleeping City or the Endless Woods. The blessed souls from Oneiros, the Sleeping City can show others the dreams dreamt by the dead, resulting in an enjoyable illusion. Damned souls from the Endless Woods share their nightmares and horrors with people. (3 acts for spells + 2 for secret)

- Manipulation of Will: A necromancer can not outright mind control a person. However by summoning the ghosts of the Rift a sort of post-hypnotic suggestion can be laid on people, by ghosts whispering into people's ears and minds ideas, feelings or courses of action of the necromancer's will.

##### Necrurgy

/u/Gwydion-Drys

[Turn 6](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fv4ovs/endless_pantheon_turn_6/fmhla43/)

Dead and dying people and animals often carry skills or training that would be wasted with the dead. A mage capable of necrurgy can remove parts of the soul from a recently dead person or animal and implant them in a living person or animal. 

In people memories of the deceased or dying often will be transported alongside the skill or ability the mage wants to transplant. 

In animals, character traits are often transferred. So the ferocity of one animal might be transferred onto another.

This is the drawback of this magic if it is misused, employed too often on the same target or performed badly, Necrurgy can lead to mental illness, most often multiple personality disorder. (5 acts for magic + 2 for secret)

### The Arrow

/u/Horatius-Cocles

[Turn 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fsee67/endless_pantheon_turn_4/fm4xmn7/)

Among the people of the Hunting Grounds the story of a very special young boy is often told. He bragged to his friends that he could shoot his arrows farther than them, farther than their fathers and farther even than the hunters of the tribes, who were known to be the best shots on Primus.

The boy's friends were fed up with his bragging and demanded for him to show them. The boy couldn't however resist bragging one last time and let his friends pick where to shoot. And they to teach him a lesson wanted him to shoot the sky itself. 

The boy was not perturbed. He knew he could not possibly reach the sky with an arrow, but giving up without even trying seemed pathetic to him. And so he climbed a tall tree to improve his odds. He took aim and fired. And to the astonishment of the boy and his friends the arrow turned into a streak of silver and in the heavens stars appeared in the shape of an Arrow.

### The Gates

Seven bright stars, all with a green and purple hue marked the beak, wing tips, two legs, the end of the tail feathers, and one at the heart of the being, were filled in with duller stars to complete the image. All glistened like bright jewels in the heavens and the beak of the great bird was anchored above the Temple-Caves of Nkan'gbamo. It would be said that the bird always flew home.

### The Wall

### The Empty Temple

/u/horatius-cocles, /u/Gwydion-Drys

[Turn 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fsee67/endless_pantheon_turn_4/fm4xmn7/)

After the disappearance of the gods, the fall of the old empires and the end of the era of legend and myth some mortals were glad to be rid of the disturbance the gods represented to the world. Some people however missed the gods and the more colorful advanced world they represented. 

Among them were a group of Apokryph and humans in the Hunting Grounds, who wanted to convince their gods to return. And that marked the begin of the construction of the Empty Temple.

Meant to be a temple to the gods like many stories of old talk about, the Empty Temple started out as a hut. A luxurious hut, but a hut nontheless. For the mortals it would have been a splendid home, but to the gods it was not. 

Crude boulders, rocks, planks of wood, hides of animals, gems and whatever else the mortals could conceive of as building materials were used to enlargen, enrich and spruce up the empty temple. It was all in all a try to bribe the gods into returning. 

And even when the gods finally did return after millenia they still did not pay attention to the Empty Temple. For all it was it was still just a hut after all. And so the Apokryph and humans keep building and changing the Empty Temple, year after year, day after day, doomed to never be finished.

The Empty Temple is situated on a hill near Sanctuary. Its internal structures are comprised of megaliths, which serve as the bones of the structure. The backroom serves as a small workshop where primitive statues of the gods are hewn from flint and limestone.

At the entrance figures maybe depicting the Sorcerer and Rictus can be found, but due to the age of the statues and the crudeity of the fabrication it is hard to tell.

Inside the main room two pits serve as sacrifice pits to burn offerings to the god in.

As it is meant to serve as a home to the gods many furs, seats and primitive tables can be found within the side rooms as well as sleeping and fire places. There are no walls per se, but with wooden struts and sticks connected to the megaliths a framework for walls is formed. The "walls" themselves consist of furs, dried foliage and wicker.

The "walls" are painted in primitive colors, mostly depicting mythological scenarios, like the creation of humans and Apokryph, the laying of Azrakal, Rak being dragged to death by the Sorcerer or the first Iron Judge sentencing Ras, the blood emperor.

### Nkan'gbamo

/u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

[Turn 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flpo5p4/)

Temple-caves with large square passages, rooms, and stairs underneath The Shattered Mountains. The walls and ceiling are littered with the jewels from when Gon formed the mountain range and glitter with any source of light. At the deepest point, the largest chamber serves as an audience hall with a single stone throne where Gon met with all the various minor gods he had pulled into his service. A smaller room off of this chamber served as his inner sanctum and living quarters.

Dropped on the second continent by Gon during its creation, The mountain range is full of jagged cracks and crevices that form caves. The nature of their formation left the tops of the mountains broken into sharp points. During their formation, Gon placed large numbers of jewels under and there remain great riches to be found.

### Blood Hunter

/u/plintstorm

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flx87zi/)

Description: Highly dangerous, intelligent, cruel, strong and bloodthirsty creature. Lives in the Savage Jungle.

### Hoarding Crab (Nkelims'kzelir)

/u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flymgvg/)

These strange hermit like crabs had exoskeletons of gray and brown that match the colors of the caves, but the back half of their body glows intensely and the gather up jewels and slowly craft them into shell like houses with mud and muck that when they occupy them causes them to glow through all the embedded colors like some crazy light show. These little creatures will take jewels from anywhere they can get them, including jewelry. If one manages to find one of their little nest holes, there is almost always a deposit of all kinds of jewels there.

### Magic Eater Fungus

/u/Horatius-Cocles 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flum9pd/)

A small symbiotic fungus living by eating magic. It lives in predators and eats the magic of their prey so they can feed on other animals.

### Nightwalker

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/fluduj9/)

**Description:** The Nightwalker is a symbiotic predator. In its primary form, it is similar to a wolf stalking through the utter darkness of the Endless Woods in the Rift. On occasion one or a few of these creatures might venture into the material plane but only occasionally.

If an individual mortal is able to fend off this wolf-like creature it takes gooey form and tries to bond itself to the person. The bonding process acts like sickness and kills the host through ensuing fever and auto-immune reactions. In 1 out of 10 cases however, the Nightwalker forms a symbiotic relationship with the host.

The bond with the Nightwalker endows it's with a sense of echolocation, though interpreting the new sensory input takes time and experience. The immune system of the host is also strengthened somewhat after fighting off the infection like the bonding process and their blood turns slightly acidic.

### Rift Tree

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/fluduj9/)

**Description:** Rift Trees don't have a fixed form. They can bee gnarly and weather-beaten, as high as mammoth trees or shaped like giant mushrooms. The single thing they have in common is they are all made from Rift Crystal. Plantlife tends to grow bigger and faster near Rift Trees. The curious forms the Rift Trees take in a patch of Rift Woods stem from these auras, speeding up plant growth, overlapping.

Rift Trees survive and spread by consuming matter and ambient energy and can thereby grow in any environment providing these. The presence of Rift Trees cools down the temperatures of their surroundings and makes it thereby easier for a patch of Rift Wood to spread.

Once in a time, a Tree will spawn a glowing pear-shaped Rift Fruit. If a fruit is planted alone in a field a single Rift Crystal Tree will sprout. To get rid of a Tree one has to sever all the roots of it. In a patch of Rift Wood, the roots of the Rift Crystal Trees grow together and connect to each other forming in essence one giant Rift Tree.

The Trees themselves look like described above only carved from blue or violet crystals and grow at the entrances to the Rift or in the Rift itself naturally. 

The fruit of the glows and be fashioned into a lamp, used by the Rift Keepers to guide the souls of the dead along to the afterlife.

### Sea Pups

/u/StarOfTheSouth

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flm1zda?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

They were small things, the adults only the size of a small wolf, and covered with a thin coating of fur. A sleek design, reminiscent of sharks, better for swimming in the water. Gills, so as to breath under the sea, a proper set of lungs, so as to breath the air while on land.

The tail was long, turning into a proper tail-fin, and the paws had to be changed a bit. Wider gaps between the toes, with some webbing between them to further assist in the water. Sharp claws, not unlike a cat, and sharper teeth would let it hunt in the water.

Smaller fins were placed on forelegs and hind legs, just above the elbow/knee joint completed the look.

### Vanilin

Description: A large scaled warm blooded creature with extremely tough jaws to scrape at metal, and the ability to work said metals into its scales, like a huge pangolin. Hunting such creatures would help those who would dwell here to use the metallic scales for their own ends, or could even potentially farm the creature.

### Malaphine

A crystalline material most useful in weapons and armor, but also usable in construction. It is very balanced in strength and give.

### Oxeblas Gems

/u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

[Turn 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fv4ovs/endless_pantheon_turn_6/fmi50gw/)

These bright red and opaque gems gathered the essence of animation from when unliving were put down in the near vicinity of them. This essence was slowly concentrated as more and more unliving were eliminated in close proximity. As they took in more and more essence they would slowly turn black and become more and more brittle.

When one of these crystals was broken that animating force would be released all at once and convert into magic energy like normal. The size of these crystals determines their capacity to contain this animating force; a totally black crystal cannot hold any more.

#### The Echoing Jungle

Creator: Lyva, ( u/smcadam )

[Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flytqr2/)

The jungle across the north of the "human continent" is equatorial and warm throughout the year, though often racked by wild weather. It is largely made of huge trees sprawling 100-300 feet tall, with distinct layers of the canopy, and full of fruit, berries, herbs and edible plantlife that rapidly regrows. Thanks to the Hex of Darkness, the lower shadowy layers are almost perpetually screaming.

The lowest levels of the forest feel almost underground, a labyrinth of roots like mangrove roots which hold vast troves of fungi. The Tralinhoof, a sinuous boneless species without ears or eyes dwells here and is the primary predator, operating almost entirely on smell. Thanks to thick hide and lack of hard tissue it is very resistant to the blasts of death, and hunts with surprising ferocity.

The second level, on shelves of old matter on the roots themselves, is home to younger trees, bushes, shrubs and wrapped in twilight at best. Agile Nehreeans, six limbed spidery reptiles vault over the weak ground here and use a poisonous bite to bring prey down before outlasting them.

The low canopy is home to the most life, much of it herbivourous and navigating using vast vines, thick branches, and huge webs. Monkeys, colourful birds, flying reptiles, snakes, lizards, sloths, tree pangolins and all manner of insects as well as mortal dwellers tend to roam in this realm. The webs are creations of Lightsnares, ghostly gigantic spiders that are somewhat transparent, and actually snare webs to impress and attract mates.

The top layers of the canopy are bright and the most fruitful, though also the most volatile and dangerous on slender branches. Fireflies provide light here almost permanently, keeping the screams from sounding, and many species of sensitive bats, birds, flying serpent and tiny monkey like creatures roam here.

#### The Great Canyon

Once a foreboding and lifeless scar on the world, The Great Canyon that divided the continent called Primus was now finally healing more then 8000 years after the wound had first been dealt. Moisture was rich here as it was funneled up from the southerly winds before getting trapped between the miles high ridges that made up the walls of the canyon, leading to a thick blanket of ever-present rain clouds covering the sky.

Under these clouds soared a multitude of life, some animals aimlessly drifted in the wind while others soared with wings as long as a man stands tall and everything in between. The plantlife itself clung to the sides of the ridges, some of the largest plants growing upward several kilometers from the base of the canyon to the tallest ridges while the floor of the canyon had a river that ran through the middle towards the sea and was coated in many tall trees, each competing for the limited amount of sun that shines down on the ravine.

Most animal life here flies in one method or another while most plants rely on alternate sources of energy then the sun to supplement their diet

Bioformed: [Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flwu3ii/)

The Great Ocean is abounding in microscopic life, particularly algae and plankton that form the basis of its food chain. Larger species like the Kymen Algae bond together into long serpent like chains, that can sometimes stretch dozens of metres long during the day.
Larger plants dominate the sea bed, with many varieties of sea weed and brine trees making food via photosynthesis and even developing fruits of sorts in order to spread. In the deeper regions, Molt Fields, large fungi claim energy from geothermal activity instead, and cover the seabed near volcanoes in a coppery thorny field.
Some species of coral and anemone can be found in the shallows, but there is not currently the variety needed for coral reefs. [I figure that's worth a seperate biome]

The vast majority of fauna in the ocean is herbivorous, with fish being the most common- species like tuna, salmon, haddock, herring, pike- along with Gildfish who stick shiny objects to their adhesive scales, Hylatlung, long sea snakes with a head at either end of their bodies, and Fareehans, gigantic fish on a scale with whales who sift and consume plankton.
Jellyfish, octopi, celaphopods, crabs and arachnids, sea scorpions, diving birds and eels survive primarily on scavenging, but are too fragile to properly hunt and kill prey.
Predators of the ocean include mertlings, feral half ape half serpent creatures, farwhals with long lance horns, shield sharks with armoured bony skulls and maws, Ripple Swarms who are small hive minded fish that sacrifice a few with every meal, sometimes causing horrific chain explosions, caprimer who are shaggy, goat fish hybrids, leonmer which are shaggy beasts covered in symbiotic weeds, and trilalungs, large winged rays with long tails who can glide above the water.

The main biohazard of the ocean is Netterkin, a large sea snake with poisonous skin, horns and a resemblance to a serpentine dragon.

A volcanic archipelago of Islands off the northern coast of Primus, created by Lyva triggering a massive eruption after a sleep. It has a vibrant and quite peaceful ecosystem with few predators built on the volcanic ash of the islands eruption. Trees growing here were tough and hardy, grass was thick, and she added peaceful creatures like kiwis, oxen, horses, goats, apes and many species of birds and snakes across the hills. In the shallow waters, large amphibious geckos as big as horses roamed, and many bright tropical insects.
