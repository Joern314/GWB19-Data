Gon listened carefully to her recounting of the world from her perspective, and in the end seemed to accept that their different viewpoints had led to at least part of their current misunderstanding. As far as he could tell, she wasn't acting deceptively and her explanation matched what Prismari had recounted. When she was done Gon sighed heavily.

"Kain... I don't get it... he couldn't leave well enough alone." He muttered as he sat up. He didn't say anything else for a moment before looking away from her. The suggestion was not one he expected.

"I wouldn't leave... how could I? I hated that I was kept at arms length from Nek and Hyla... I would never do that to my own blood." He said quietly, but with a strong determination as set his right hand on his left forearm. "Besides, we're on to something... no new runes have appeared this time. I cannot say for sure, but... I think it has something to do with your heart. I think... maybe... whatever it is works only on me, as I was or as I am..."

"Also, Lyva... you are selling yourself short." Gon admitted after another moment as he looked back to her. "You don't think you would be a good mother? I have seen the the lengths you are willing to go to when there is something you want."

"Being possessive of a child is a part of motherhood, and you have shared many things over the years with me when we were younger. Did that bother you? I was yours then, and a child would be yours in much the same way."
