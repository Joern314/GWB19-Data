**Crisis: The Geyser Erupts**

The Nkarlen, able to eat all kinds of rocks and dirt were quick to eat plenty of live crystals simply by being them. The enhancements made the already numerous and fatalistic goblins even more dangerous. Already Gon had equipped them with the ability to petrify the dire beasts during the last such crisis, and now they were even equipped with explosives weaved from oxeblas crystals and their gem weaving magic to create what amounted to landmines and hand grenades. Additionally, these explosions were the result of the production of magic, so any petrification mages could easily redirect that magic to hit an already injured creature with magic.

Gon, however, viewed the rain of that the Nkarlen as a resource to be used, and a renewable one at that. So as the full green moon reached its zenith, casting the land in a strange glow, poured divine energy into the goblins. He let them tap into the strength and resilience of the earth as they consumed these crystals. That would make them fight on better terms with the dire beasts or whatever enemies they encountered. The more crystals, the more goblins with enhanced strength there would be.

To make sure that they knew this was his doing, he also informed his clergy of the situation and what had happened.
