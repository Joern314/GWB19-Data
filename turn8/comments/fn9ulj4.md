###Kiln Heresy II- The Great Hatching     

As Sabin was told of her Deity's impending child and something of her origins, rumour's of Lyva's impending child spread. Children were meant to exceed their parents, and so the legend spread that great new green moon in the sky which blocked out even the sun was the egg of the incoming deity, to be hatched in the next century, who would work to reforge the world just as the great fires had reforged Lyvkerel some sixty years prior.     

The emergence of vampires, or the changes to the Apokyrph, or the growth of Dire Beasts were seen as impurities in the world, which the next serpent, soon to be named **Koradesil** would burn out along with everything else, and turn the planet to its perfect state as a star.
