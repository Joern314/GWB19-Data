"Them burning everything is... a little concerning." Gon smirked, a touch of guilt in his voice. After a moment he kissed her and laughed as he tapped her metallic body with a claw.

"I've never thought you needed protection, dear. I was just happy to be your sword... Blowing yourself up is some impressive dedication to winning... but it was a little on the crazy side. Not that I can say much about that..."

"I will think on it more. Attempting to kill Kain's creation now... I didn't have the same perspective then. I can understand why Prismari might have wanted to protect it... not sure I agree with his evaluation of the situation, though." The new father said with a frown, obviously conflicted after a moment he perked up and grinned broadly.

"Oh, but you might want to rethink that argument... I think I would love having more of you around." He laughed as he squeezed her tight.
