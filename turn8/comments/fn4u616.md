"Congratulate? Oh... thanks." Gon replied first before pulling out a black book and opening it to a marked page. His tone was plain, almost bored.

"Lyva came to me and told much the same story you told me... I had the minor gods under my command investigate for any unusual activity and it would seem... considering what Livi said, that you were telling the truth... and it would appear that I got carried away."

"So as is only proper for circumstances such as these... I have come to apologize." Gon sighed and bowed.

"I am sorry for attacking you and the child."
