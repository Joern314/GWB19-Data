[ several years later ] 


Prismari with the occasional unhelpful help of lyva over the last twenty years had been raising the  little godling. he had given her the first name Zara along with a last name mair  

He had picked the first name because he liked it when he heard a mortal call there daughter that and lyva forbid him naming her bismair and the last name to prove she was his daughter 

Though unlike mortal children... it seemed little Zara had only aged five years in the last twenty and so was a sweet girls  whom greatly resembles her “mother”  lyva. Zara slime like body had formed and for the most par Harded  to that of a human toddler albeit with small horns and rainbow metal hair. She wear a cute little dress and a single rainbow ribbon  around  a single horn... and let’s not forget the jelly hat never the same jellyfish twice  ... something which annoyed Prismari who keep removing them and yet for the life of him couldn’t figure out where this little child was getting  jellyfishes 

“Daddy? Why doesn’t mommy take care of me as much as you do ?” Zara asked with a frown 

“I told you it’s auntie lyva  my little bundle of colour  .... not mommy. “ Prismari explained for the fifteenth time today Zara refused to accept his reasoning as any five year old would. Prismari had made the mistake of point at lyva and calling her mommy once and Zara had ran with it ever sense 

“ I’m going go find her !” Zara said running out of Prismari floor of the divine  tower up to lyva Prismari chasing quickly after her 

“MOMMY MOMMY OPEN UP OR ILL EXPLODE THE DOOR.” She screamed with joy at lyva door
