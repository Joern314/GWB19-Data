###Prompt: A Purely Mortal Struggle III

Yrdin, having brought the Iron Law to Epoidos, died as the Chief Justice of the city. Having reached his dream of defying the cast system and being promoted from the citizens to the philosophers, but not his dream to become a Guardian, a mighty warrior and defender of his people, he thought he had failed that particular dream. 

But despite that in a roundabout way he had accomplished what he had set out to do. He had become a defender of the people by bringing them the protection of the law.

In fact among the people of the world he was one of the few to never reach an the Rift. Instead he ascended to be a hero. And in times of need and crisis his sleeping soul would manifest to give sage counsel or imbue a worthy mortal with the power of an Iron Judge to stand up to injustice. 

And so Yrdin even defied the conventions of death.

###Crisis: The Geyser Erupts

The Sorcerer had granted the race of Apokryph blessings beyond those of many other mortals. Among them was longevity, but also innate magical talents to enable people to think faster and better if they were destined for the caste of philosophers, to fight longer and harder and be blessed with sharper senses if they were meant to be guardians, and to be more enduring, able to tolerate hard work better and improved dexterity and wit to perform the tasks of the citizens. Coupled with the mages inane talents for magic and the longer life spans the Apokryph of Secundus had the magic of the Sorcerer running through their veins and were able to use necromancy, necrurgy and the other runes of the Sorcerer to succesfully either keep out of the dire beasts way, or slay them with their magics and the talents of the most formidable of the dead translpanted onto the living. Even the Sorcerer himself in his Avatar participated in the guise of the Vir Sacra, the Sorcerer's prophet in the hunt for the dire beasts. 

###Prompt: Heresy II

Many among the Apokryph had gained scraps of necromantic knowledge and tried to travel the Rift or summon spirits of the dead. However in their botched attempts they either summoned Apokryphs, who had died in foreign realities aeons ago or messed up their memories while traveling between planes.

The result was a jumbled mess of information of the ends of many worlds. No two people could settle on one way the world would. Some cited meteors falling on the world, or a big shadow coming to devour or mate with the world, depending on who you asked. Others talked about giant mortal made moons in the sky firing with divine power or possessed by the divine themselves. Others talked about hellish dimensions revealing themselves or mutating sicknesses
