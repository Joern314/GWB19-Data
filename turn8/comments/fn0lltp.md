[Quoting /u/gwydion-drys with an explanation of how his (so far the only elaborate) afterlife works:]

> [For the Mortal Struggle Prompt:

> If you are sending your people to the Rift, the Sorcerer's default afterlife, they are collected by some of the Apokryph living in the rift, called Rift Keepers. Depending on if they were assholes in life by their culture's standard they either end up in the endless woods being hunted by their own nightmares given shape and the other souls condemned to wander the woods and their nightmares. 

> The other factors for getting tossed into the endless woods is pissing off the Sorcerer, by attacking or somehow maliciously treating the Apokryph living in the material plane.

> Or they end up in Oneiros, the Sleeping City, where they can either do mortal stuff and live beside the Rift Keepers, or choose to sleep eternity away in a dream of their choosing, or both.]

> [Forgot to mention the Sorcerer isn't home right now. He is in an avatar and therefore nor omni-present. So if you want an asshole to sneak into the city, it is possible to do that.]
