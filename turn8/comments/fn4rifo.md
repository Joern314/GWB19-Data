##The Burning Egg     

After the arrival of Zara, Lyva elected to create a child of her own. For several years she was the same as ever, though seemingly greedier and more impatient, with a growing heat within. Eventually, she retreated in the mantle of the planet where she had slept, resuming her great draconic form as she drifted in eddies of molten metal, her power draining inwards. Mortals had already panicked at the creation of one new moon in recent times, thanks to Gon, and so she laid her egg within the mantle, a great metal sphere that would fragment and return to the core.     

It was another two years of slumbering and hugging the egg protectively, before she felt the heat from it intensify, and cracks began to warp the metal. The great divine dragon coiled and spiralled around the egg excitedly, struck almost dumb with fear and hope. Yet as it cracked, burning gas spilling to form new elements, the creature within was tiny.      

Soon Lyva emerged from the molten core in her humanoid form, slag and ash flaking off her tail and horns, though heat blazed in her arms. The child there resembled their parents, a tailed baby with fluffy wiry down across its back, a long tail wrapped around their mothers arms, smoke and fire billowing from their lungs as they cried loud and sharp.         

"**Gon, Yana is here,**" She whispered anxiously in godspeak, collapsing in the tunnels as she hugged and tried to calm the newborn Demigod of Fire.
