"But why did you do those things? I heard rumour that your mother didn't accept you at first. And why did you change?" He said, but then waved his hand and shook his head.

"As for Kain... let's say that the moon is just about the only stable ground that he is safe on. If I get even one tingling sensation that he sets foot on *my* land..." Gon grumbled irritably.

"Nek was... well... Nek. If... you mean my *original* father... I... don't fully remember... I vaguely remember him teaching me to fight, to hunt prey... hrrrm, that's about it. My memories from before are slowly returning through my dreams... but I am not who I was... I do not want to be. I want to be the Gon *you* know."

"I have not been a father before as far as I recall, but I believe I could be. I-I know it could turn out badly... but I have managed a lot without even fully knowing who I am. Compared to that... can't be that hard, right?" He laughed with a hint of nervousness and smiled softly at her.

"So my answer is... yes." He replied more firmly. "I think I could."
