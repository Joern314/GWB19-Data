While Rictus was fighting the dire beasts in the western lands, messengers from Sanctuary reached him of attacks on the great forest.

While in an avatar Rictus could not be in two places at once. And therefore he summoned his most senior companion, Ferus, the demigod of memory.

Ferus at once took up his bow. He travelled east to sanctuary and immediately began teaching people how to become free mages. 

The miracle of free magery allowed to learn skills of war faster and replicate the effects of magic. So it was a very potent weapon.

A united force of Iron Judges, Free Mages and Waidm√§nner began patrolling the southern regions of the hunting grounds. Feathering any enemy with arrows or their miraculous powers.
