"Not fair! Share!" Yana protested the idea of Zara having her own personal father, even as they were lifted to the beast. They wriggled and screamed, engulfing the bear in flames while Zara bombarded it with explosions, and very soon the gigantic predator was much burnt meaty chunks across the ground. Which Yana soon picked up and began to stack.    

"Having fun?" Lyva chuckled as she appeared, and knelt as Yana stomped up, tugged open her back and began to stow roasted mutant bear meat.   

"I found lunch. Now it's quiet. Zara doesn't share. I like her." They reported, then hugged Lyva tight.   

"Oh really? Well we might eat this sure, and she seems to have taken good care of you. What do you say?" Lyva prompted, putting them down before the demigoddess.    

"Sharing is... Oh. .. hello, I'm Yana." They muttered in confusion.   

"...gratitude." Lyva coughed.   

"OH! Oh Thankyou Zara!" Yana exclaimed and hugged her tight, "Come back soon and burn world with me! Not much left, halfway now!"
