#The Burning Forest

It have been many generations of the blood riders ridding and raiding the forest people.  
Now however, one great leader among them have united a large amount of them.  
He leads his people toward the forest and instead of attacking it, they merely wait outside, and fire burning arrows in to the forest.  

They know they can't win a fight in the forest, to many hiding spots and their horses are slowed to a crawl inside there.

So the answer is clear, remove the forest.

Of course, the forest is large, no way they can burn all of it in a single go.

[/u/horatius-cocles, /u/downsmi1, Some of the blood riders are burning the great forest.  
naturally, they being impatient little buggers means they won't be able to burn all of it without losing patience and leaving.  

So, how you wish to deal with this? Attack them? That means coming outside the forest, they ain't going in, and in the open plain, they got the advantage of mounted combat and numbers.  
Just let them be, because the forest is freaking huge?  
Say 'fuck it' and start purging the blood riders in a crusade?

I expect this to be a very, very, very long term project (given the size of the great forest), so plenty of different strikes and attacks to burn the forest, or at least, parts of it.]
