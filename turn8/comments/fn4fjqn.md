###A Purely Mortal Struggle III

Udeis luck finally ran out and the Iron Judges and Waidmänner finally caught up to him. He was sentenced to a quick execution for the people killed in his shady dealings.

Being clever and willing to go to extremes had him kept ahead of the Iron Law for decades, but even that wasn't enough to run forever in the end. 

He was swiftly beheaded and the Rift Keepers collected his soul. Against the powers of the Iron Judges and death even the quick wit of Udeis had not been enough.

Cast into the Endless Woods and hunted for many decades by his own nightmares of rival gangs and thugs, he finally managed to use one of the Sorcerer's absences to sneak into the Sleeping City under the name of someone else. Someone's whose soul had and would never reach the Rift, as the person in question had been turned into a mortal hero.

And so he dreamed the endless dreams of heroic and a warrior's life of Yrdin the Iron Judge in the Sleeping City.

###The Geyser Erupts

Rictus hearing tales of the wild beasts of the west, decided to travel there himself. Seeing the need to give the people hunters that could defend them, he taught the people of the west his miracle to produce Waidmänner, the world's best hunters and how to use magical arrows to slay the dire beasts from afar. In fact he participated himself in the hunt. 

###Heresy II

The tribes of the hunting grounds have heard many different tales of the apocalypse. Through telling and retelling and the compilation of different stories the most widespread theory on the end of the world emerged and was passed on.

A wave of fire and ice will deplete the worlds forests and game. Then a foreign race of red skinned mortals will wash over the land consuming what is left. Sentient construction filled with the voices of the dead will scatter the mortals that are left. Horned beasts will emerge to trample the earth until it is completely barren. And then snakes of iron and giant spider webs will spread over the earth until it is drowned in rivers of stone.

The only thing the humans of the hunting grounds see differently is the time it will take for the world to end. They think the time is measured in aeons instead of years.
