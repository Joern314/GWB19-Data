"Yes, grandad is daddy's daddy... but you're a demigod just now, Yana, like your mommy and daddy were once. We worked real hard and became gods. Maybe one day if you work really hard for it you can become a full god too." Gon with a smile. He brought the tip of his tail up in front of the child where it continued to wave back and forth slightly.

"Anyway, your grandaddy was covered in feathers, all bright and orange, yellow, and red like fire. He could change shape just like mommy and I can. He could be a tiny bird..." The young father explained holding his hands a short distance apart, before grinning and throwing his hands open wide as his tail thumped behind him, either for extra effect or in natural reaction to the motion. 

"Or he could be a big, enormous bird, with wings that could spread across this whole cave." Laughed the half-lizard god.

"He used to live in a place surrounded by ashes where great twisters of fire whirled. ...When he found out that there were some bad people living on the lands he created he went out to use his powers of fire to defeat them. He even saved a little girl who went on to be the queen of the people of the sky."

Gon went on telling little tidbits about his father, avoiding some of the less appropriate ones, like how he treated Gon or anything about the slavers. He hoped the stories might teach the child a few things, as well as hold his attention for a little while.

"So, Yana, wanna know something else amazing? Grandaddy and your mommy's mommy used to be neighbors. Did mommy tell you what she looked like?" Gon asked eventually.
