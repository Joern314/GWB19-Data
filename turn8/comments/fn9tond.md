###Idren's Struggle III      

As the years passed and word of Idren's hunt spread, the apokryph sailor found himself hunted by agents of other vampires, and a couple of vampires who had managed to recover from his assaults. He had to sail to flee, travelling around the seas he loved more and more, until the day came when several mutineers were paid to sneak amidst his crew and wait for the perfect moment.      

It came during a great storm, said to be a sign of Kain battling in the heavens, and the five men broke the rudder and wheel, cutting the ropes of the sails. Battle ensued as Idren turned his fury upon them, but the ship was too damaged to sail properly and sank, crashing on the rocks near the Kiln Isles he had left so long ago.    

When morning came, half of the crew remained, seeking for their lord, hero and captain, but the body of Idren was never found, and many including vampires suspected his death to be faked, to give him space to retire in peace. Only his cutlass was found, stained red with bloody rust, and those who took it up named it **Leechbane**, for the blade seemed to cut vampires deeper than any other, leaving wounds that their regeneration would not properly heal.     

In truth, all of Idren's magic and legend soaked into the blade as his body vanished, while his soul ventured into the Rift with the aid of the Rift Keepers. There, the sailor found rest for a short time, but soon hungered for adventure once more, and ventured out into the Endless Woods, determined to battle his nightmares and map the pattern of the shifting horrors.
