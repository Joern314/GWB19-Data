Prompt: A Purely Mortal Struggle III

Motley after a long time wandering the world and working as a surgeon of sorts in all lands of the world returned to the jumbled mountains. She told strange and wondrous stories of dangers and beautiful things she had seen and died as an elder of the jumbled. She had said the outside held much danger and beauty and any jumbled were often seen with fear and mistrust. So she warned people to be careful but encouraged them so more of the world.

Upon her death, the parts of her body were used in as far as possible and her soul moved on the Rift, to dream of exploring even more fantastical places, not ever seen in this world.

Crisis: The Geyser Erupts

The people of the jumbled mountains did not suffer under the effects of the dire beasts too much. As goddess of fear Glypha spread a permanent aura of fear around her jumbled creations. It was however not affecting people, only dire beasts. The jumbled to the dire beasts looked like their natural predators and so the dire beasts tended to stay away from the jumbled mountains, who was a land of things trying to eat them for the dire beasts.

Prompt: Heresy II

The people of the jumbled mountain lived a very sheltered life. Not often did news from the outside world arrive. And when it did it was not good.

Distorted version of the truth were often told around campfires. But given their own living situation in relative safety, prosperity and freedom, the jumbled could not help but believe that if the world was to end it would not be in fire but peace.

The end of the world in the eyes of the jumbled would see a global peace and a life for everyone free of sorrow or hardship. 

Glypha had given the jumbled a stretch of paradise. And when the gods would choose to end the world, they would not destroy it, but turn it into a utopia not unlike the jumbled mountains but even better.

They had however no way of knowing when that time would arrive.
