The Sorcerer had been experimenting with necrurgy and how to custom build a personality with this kind of magic. He had also studied the metaphysics of Glypha, allowing her people to build bodies from a wide variety of body parts and make functioning mortals out of them. He had the mechanics of building a personality down to an art after decades of trial and error. But he sadly lacked the skill to produce a mortal body without the use of his own divine power. And so he went looking for the goddess of fear and flesh.

“Lady Glypha! I am the Sorcerer, god of magic and death. I am here to seek your assistance with a one of a kind experiment I wish to perform.”
