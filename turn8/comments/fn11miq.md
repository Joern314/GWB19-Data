"There you are!" Lyva exclaimed as she found Gon on the umpteenth try, appearing somewhat ashen and iron skinned, her eyes blazing with emotion.     

"I heard you tried to kill the little mercury demigod, or something." She breathed, sitting down, fists clenched, "I almost did too. As soon as I saw it, I thought about just erasing it from the universe. But that seemed wasteful. It's not like killing a God, but erasing a demigod would exhaust my power. And I thought Oryllia was a good... angelic person now but she insisted I be responsible.... I don't understand what she means, I thought giving a child to someone who'd be a good parent was being responsible?"    

She frowned and looked at him, molten eyes dripping small glowing tears.
