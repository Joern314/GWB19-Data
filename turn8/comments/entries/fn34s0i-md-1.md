# None [None]
"You sure?" Gon asked softly and gently kissed her before tilting his head in thought.

"Somewhere amazing..." He thought out loud and then with a smile scooped her up in both arms and teleported them somewhere different.

As Gon set her back down, Lyva found herself standing on soft white sands next to a small underground lake, where a small shaft of light illuminated a gentle waterfall at the far side. The light glittered softly off of the clear blue freshwater. The bottom was bright and visible, seemingly lined in the same white sand. The air was so clean and cool that one could almost taste it.

More impressive, however, was the rest of the cavern. The light from the water reflected onto what appeared to be massive crystals of all sorts. They were larger than any man was around and jutted into the cave in all sorts of different angles some passing clean from ceiling to floor. Smaller crystals covered the rest of the walls, like the inside of a enormous geode. Their collective thousands of facets scattered the already wavy light reflected off the clear pool all over the cavern, producing rainbows in some places and odd spots of light in others.

The small beach she found herself on was like a small strip of a crescent moon amidst the crystalline cavern. It was clear that Gon had been here before, judging by the mixture of dinosaur and bird-like foot prints. It was also apparently where he kept a small pile of curious jewels and a small crater-like divot in the sand was lined with what appeared to be all the feathers he had ever shed. Gon said nothing at first, letting the gentle sound of the waterfall echo softly over the crystals and letting Lyva enjoy the scenery.

"I found this place a while back. It seems to have formed when we made this continent; an unintentional creation, but a wonderful one. This is where I hide when I grow weary of listening to the babble of mortals. It is far from any of them... I have not named it either... no name for it would do it justice." He explained in a quiet, almost reverent tone.

"At night, just a little bit of starlight from the divine constellations and sometimes moonlight reflects of the pool... not enough to light the whole cavern, but it gives the cavern a completely different feel."

"Oh and pardon my little sleeping spot, I didn't feel like something manufactured like a bed should be in a place like this... and I had to do something with the excess feathers from changing forms." Gon laughed, trying to cover up a slight bit of his own nervousness or embarrassment. The cave echoed softly in response.
