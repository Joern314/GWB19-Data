# None [None]
The Sorcerer had asked Glypha for a service. His goal was an interesting one. And so Glypha decided to procure the one item she needed to do as he asked. In fact the one goddess who could provide what Glypha was Lyava, who had been the Sorcerer's partner in crime in bringing the Apokryph to this world. Lyva's world, if she was to be believed.

Lyva had however just created offspring of her own. So a little present would be in order. And so Glypha went to call on the goddess of greed.
