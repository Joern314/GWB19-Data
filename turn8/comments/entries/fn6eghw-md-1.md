"Do not presume so much malice in *my* words, I am only pointing out that you have no grounds to judge others if you are party to such actions.

"That is a wonderful painting that your father has made, Zara." He said still crouched down to her level with a smile that seemed to remain even when he straightened up to look at Kain.

"I am glad we are in agreement then, Kain. No more stepping on my dirt. Not that I trust your words anymore..."

Gon sighed and looked to Prismari with a sad smile and brought his clawed hand up to his chest. He looked away after a moment. 

"Children... I have never had the desire protect anything... it's different... I've always been a sword, not a shield... I couldn't understand why you would want to  protect something made out of spite for the one you loved... now... I am sorry, truly." Gon admitted quietly, before shaking his head and grinning at Zara.

"Zara, train hard with Prismari, alright? I expect you to be able to beat big bad villains, like me, when you come down to the world. Got it?"
