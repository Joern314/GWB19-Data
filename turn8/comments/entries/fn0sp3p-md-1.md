**Dreams of Divinity: A Familiar Face**

*The crisp crunch of the woman riding on Gon's shoulders was followed by her pale legs kicking into his chest in joy. They lacked any shoes and were as cold as ice.*

*"Ssso winterrr is coming sssoon? That'sss alwaysss when you show up, Igki..." he grumbled through his sharp teeth as he continued to drag the corpse of his prey behind him. His stomach growled. The woman ignored the question.*

*"Mmm... This is a delicious apple, you suuure you don't want a bite?" The woman said in a cool and smooth voice. Gon felt her shift to lean one elbow on his head and a crunch heralded another bite.* 

*"My brotherrr and I can only eat meat..." Lizardman Gon replied as he continued to trudge through the bright woodlands where the trees were showing the bright oranges, reds, and yellows of fall.*

*"Such a shame." The cold woman replied smoothly and brushed his feathers gently. "Hmm... have you ever wanted to change that, Gon? Wouldn't you like to taste the other foods the world has to offer? Maybe... get rid of that tail?"*

*Gon stopped and his tail twitched from side to side in minor irritation. "If... I did..."*

*"I bet you'd be really quite handsome... you should keep the feathers, though. I like their colors." She said softly and smoothed the feathers on his head and a thump off to the side of the trail indicated she had thrown away whatever remained of the apple. "Then the mortals won't be so scared of you tromping about the forests."*

*"Hrrrm... I think... that would be nissse... being hunted all the time isss rrreally irrritating. They all think I'd make a wonderrrful trrrophy."*

*"Let's do it then." The woman announced as she clambered down his back. Gon turned to look  at her. A soft smile and happy eyes as blue as the sky and flecked with white met him. Snow white hair cascaded over her shoulders and fell across a form fitting icy blue dress that glistened with the usual fresh frost in the fading sunlight.*

*"Ah, but once you have changed you'll have to call me by my proper name, alright? No more of this calling me 'Igki'... Call me Atka, alright?"*

"So that's what happened..." Gon said as he stirred and stretched. Getting blown up twice in such a short time - at least for the divine - sure had made him stiff. "Igki... Atka... hrrrm..."

"Purr... You don't have very good luck with females do you?" Nkom commented sleepily from the foot of his bed.

"Shut. It. Before I make you a female and see how well you fare in a fight against them."

"At least I wouldn't destroy such fine made clothes. You're going through gem outfits faster than... purr... if you were Livi, Master Gon." Nkom replied in a silky smooth tone, turning his head away and closing his eyes once more.

"... I'll be on the green moon if you need me, keep an eye on the place would you?" Gon sighed, not feeling like arguing with the gem-lion before heading off to the new moon he had created to heal himself in the aftermath of Lyva's atomic detonation.
