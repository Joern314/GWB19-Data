# None [None]
Over the weeks it became part of Zara routine to go out and speak to Malaphet or as she called him mr jellyfish

She would speak to him and explode things.... mostly training dummies... she had no clue that he was a world eating space monster and at the moment likely wouldnâ€™t care. she just liked having a friend on the moon
