# The Geyser Erupts [None]

One again, dire beasts walk the land.  
clearly, there is only one thing to do.

Azrakal made the beasts bleed from their mouths, fangs and claws.  
Any wound these dire beasts made with this blood would never stop bleeding.

[-3 acts: Ever bleeding wounds for Dire Beasts]
