# Prompt: A Purely Mortal Struggle III [None]

Yrdin, having brought the Iron Law to Epoidos, died as the Chief Justice of the city. Having reached his dream of defying the cast system and being promoted from the citizens to the philosophers, but not his dream to become a Guardian, a mighty warrior and defender of his people, he thought he had failed that particular dream. 

But despite that in a roundabout way he had accomplished what he had set out to do. He had become a defender of the people by bringing them the protection of the law.

In fact among the people of the world he was one of the few to never reach an the Rift. Instead he ascended to be a hero. And in times of need and crisis his sleeping soul would manifest to give sage counsel or imbue a worthy mortal with the power of an Iron Judge to stand up to injustice. 

And so Yrdin even defied the conventions of death.
