Over the last several months explosion had been happening on the land just outside the habitable zoon Of the moon, much to the annoyance of the ophis 

It seemed little Zara from the safety of the atmosphere had been practicing her sphere and some of the telekinesis lyva has given her 

After awhile she noticed a lot of the stars moved and other stayed the same.... wondering why and doing what she did best she cause in explosion as far in space as possible trying to get what ever was in space attention 

Prismari was watching from the window waiting to jump out and protect Zara if Malaphet did something stupid
