“Sooo cute!” Zara said the moment the star eye appeared 

She then tired her best to screech at Malaphet back in his own language... it sounded like a little child screeching

“Why do you speak like that? Can I speak like that... oh watch this   “ she said creating an explosion well think the little eye thing was cute and silly
