Gon spent as much time as possible helping Lyva raise their child, teaching them as much as he could, and relieving Lyva when she needed a break from Yana's antics. The time he spent with the pair of them seemed to have an effect on him. Being a father was strange to him, and finally one day while they were both watching Yana in the caves around Amalah he sat down next to Lyva seemingly concerned about something.

"How are you doing, love? Are you happy to be a mother?" He asked quietly with a soft smile.
