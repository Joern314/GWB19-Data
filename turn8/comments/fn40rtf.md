**A Purely Mortal Struggle**

Part III: The Pillar Goblin

Dealego's desires eventually went too far when he decided that he should replace the Jikzek sitting on the stone throne. He became too proud of his abilities and believed himself invincible, causing the four previously dormant Misrei of Kzivo'gbamo to turn on him realizing that he was a danger to everyone.

Vampires were, of course, quite strong and did not go down easily, but they were still far too few in number to worry the fatalistic leaders of the various Misrei. The initial battle went poorly as hundreds of goblins were slain, suffering more from their wounds than Dealego himself, but there was a different sort of problem he had; the more and more he fought the more times he was hit by the onslaught of petrfication magic, as his killing of the unliving filled the air with usable magic.

Despite his willingness to cut pieces from his body that had turned to stone, he could not keep up.

The remaining statue that he became with all of his pieces was fashioned into a support at the deepest section of the Nkarlen tunnels and sealed away. With the short age of goblins and there fast moving society, the room was forgotten.

It is said that he still rests within the stone, his soul trapped forever until the day that someone awakens him once more.

While Dealego vanished, stories of other vampires still circulated in the cities of the goblins. Though it appeared that if more existed they had the sense to avoid becoming the public enemy, and the disappearance of a few goblins here and there was a common occurrence even without vampires lurking in the caves.
