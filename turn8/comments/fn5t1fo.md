##A Purely Mortal Struggle III

Raldric had been fighting most of his entire life, he had even returned to the blood plains after fighting in two wars.

There, he spread his knowledge that fighting on foot could be done with great strength. Some of his ideas did start to catch on, but he was old, very old and one day, he fell asleep and never woke up. Sure, his body did but he did not.

Raldric woke up in Oneiros, the Sleeping City, there, he continued his training and to fight, he was a master at both mounted combat and fighting on foot and he saw no reason to stop.

##Heresy II

In Redgash, the Vengeful said their struggle was to end, they would break though Amalah and take it's place as it's rightful rulers.  
The Vengeful would have their home back.  

Great blood would be spilled, the sky itself would rain blood from the red god himself. And the Black Lady would embrace her people.

Only after this, would the world be allowed to end.
