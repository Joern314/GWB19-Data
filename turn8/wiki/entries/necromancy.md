The art of communing with the spirits of the dead and employ them for the mages ends and means, either by traveling to the Rift and dealing with them directly, or by summoning them into the prime material plane by use of magical runes and rituals. There are two ways to cast any spell of necromancy.

- Katabasis

The act of traveling the Rift and seeking out the dead is fraught with peril, however necromancers undertaking this risk will find the dead much more willing to deal with them and following their commands. The spirits of the dead the necromancer wishes to employ then accompany the necromancer to the prime material plane. To allow them to do such their way needs to be paid by magical energies. In essence the mage visits the ghost and accompanies him to do his magical task.

- Summoning

Under the use of runes taught by the Sorcerer and consumption of magical energies a ghost can be raised straight from the Rift. However planar travel tends to muddle the mind, even of the dead, so any answers ghosts summoned this way are to be taken with a grain of salt and they may object to be torn out of the afterlife and spells they are employed for may be less potent.
