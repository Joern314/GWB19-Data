These bright red and opaque gems gathered the essence of animation from when unliving were put down in the near vicinity of them. This essence was slowly concentrated as more and more unliving were eliminated in close proximity. As they took in more and more essence they would slowly turn black and become more and more brittle.

When one of these crystals was broken that animating force would be released all at once and convert into magic energy like normal. The size of these crystals determines their capacity to contain this animating force; a totally black crystal cannot hold any more.
