# Subject Villages [The City on the Well]

Gwanyin is not the only settlement in the Silroin Caldera. It has many smaller neighbors, a series of Farming Villages. The City holds sway over these Villages through its two great resources: Life Essence and Warriors.

The City is dependent upon the Villages for food, and it protects them *fiercely*. Any invading force that seeks to raid a Caldera Village is inviting vengeance from Gwanyin. When word of an attack reaches the City, a force of well-trained and well-disciplined soldiers will inevitably be dispatched... generally with a party of five members of the Order of War attached to them.

Likewise, the Villages are dependent upon Gwanyin for the Life Essence. Mixing Life-Essence into the water that irrigates their crops is the *foundation* of the Villagers' rampant success. They trade roughly a quarter of their crop at harvest time, and in exchange the Order of Life will supply them with Life Essence in the Spring. This ensures that their crops are bountiful, allowing them to trade freely with tribes wise enough to *trade* rather than *raid*.
