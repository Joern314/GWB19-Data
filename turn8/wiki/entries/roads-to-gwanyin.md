# The Roads to Gwanyin [The City on the Well]

Gwanyin's Weakness was also one of its defensive strengths. It was nestled in a Volcanic Caldera... at the top of a very tall Mountian. There were only a handful of roads that could lead a man to the Silroin Caldera, and the City of Gwanyin at its center. Most of them were ancient affairs, unpaved but still *relatively* passable, which circled the mountain's edges and cut through natural caverns on their way up into the caldera. The rest were natural paths. 

This posed a slight *problem* as commerce began to flow up the sides of the mountain. Wear and tear on the paths had caused them to *degrade* over time. If nothing was done, the roads would eventually turn to rubble... and passage would be restricted to the natural paths. Those would grow congested, and in time they would wear away... and rock-slides and avalanches would become serious problems. Repairing and reinforcing the roads was a colossal task for the people of Gwanyin... but it became a priority.

In the meantime, something had to be done to keep the roads open. The solution... was a rough one. Travel up and down the mountain was heavily controlled. The Order of Life's Bureaucrat-Priests worked to figure out *who* should walk *which* road to reach Gwanyin. They took careful accounting of the *weight* of those who traveled, and tried to do their best to send them on paths that could bear them.

The Systems they developed would remain even after the roads were repaired... and would be used to limit damage to the roads and keep the maintenance budget under control.
