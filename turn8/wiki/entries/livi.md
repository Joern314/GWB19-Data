**Sphere**: Lava

**Description**:
A stunning young woman made of lava that cools to form an obsidian outer skin for her, she is marked by cracks of lava and oversees its natural flow beneath the surface. She is a bit air-headed from the number of gods that had been thrown into the planet forming volcanoes and it is said that any volcanic eruption is a result of her messing up her job.

In reality,it is also her responsibility to manage the lava flows on the surface of the planet.
