# Gon Gryn, Vengeance Reborn [Gods]

**Player**: /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

**Spheres**: Earth and Vengeance

**Appearance**:
A tall and muscular half-bird, half-elven man - a race known as the Gryn - with earthy brown skin covered in bright white scars. The most noticeable of these is the scar over his left eye. In place of hair, he has a crest of feathers similar in appearance to a filled-in native american chief’s headdress. These feathers fade from a bright green to a vibrant purple, with three longer feathers fading from purple to green. Green eyes flecked with purple seem to be full of intensity and he usually wears an odd smirk. Below the knees his legs become those of an eagle and end in sharp black talons. Gon doesn’t seem particularly picky about what he wears, and can often be found wearing whatever clothes are provided to him by Lyva. He does slightly favor dressing in white, but for formal occasions he dresses in a green feather robe; a memento of his “father”. In battle, he wears traditional Arakyl feathermail over a purple padded tunic. The only thing he consistently has on his person is a particular sword known as The Retaliator with its plain dark leather sheath and belt.

**Plans and Style**:
Gon has only recently ascended into godhood and the shift from a demi-god to a full fledged divine being has left a mark on him. He intends to make the best of his new powers and rather simply enjoy himself. The fetters of fate, however, may not be so easy to sever.

Being the amnesiatic form of a god from another existence, Gon has a strange mix of apathy and curiosity about him. He has a knack for understanding magic and seeks it out with enthusiasm, but tends to laze around otherwise. Outwardly friendly, Gon only truly enjoys the company of those who have become consumed by some desire; he enjoys seeing them work tirelessly towards their goals. Especially if those goals include revenge.

**Origin**:
Gon was a semi-divine being created partially from the soul fragment of a god with the same name from the Fire Realm and the memories and personality of the phoenix god, Nekalos Toneyl. His former self was apparently destroyed along with Nek’s home realm, but the god attempted to achieve resurrection in a new plane of existence by placing a fragment of his soul in the banished phoenix god. Interference from the Serpent Goddess Celastra of Space, Secrets, and Shadows caused the plan to fail and Gon’s memories were stolen and placed into a demigoddess known as Lyva. Following the recreation of his body as a demigod, the amnesiatic Gon - known as Hunger - found himself somewhat enamored with the demigoddess and her greed. Seeking refuge from a dysfunctional family relationship with Nek and his demigoddess daughter, Hylatka, Hunger decided he would stay with Lyva. Once Lyva had achieved true divinity, Hunger agreed to travel away from the world with her to seek his own divinity elsewhere.

Divinity itself, however, has a price; as he traveled with Lyva, Gon was able to modify the so-called “Toneyl Divinity Manipulation Magic” developed by Hylatka and create a divine spark by siphoning the power of souls consumed by his blade into himself. Unfortunately, this seems to have had some side effects…
