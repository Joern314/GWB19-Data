Lyva seemed incredibly relaxed and unconcerned, almost statuesque if not for gentle breathing, and she rolled over as he spoke.    

"Divinity is strange." She said eventually, "My godhood is my uncle's. They were two beings. Perhaps they let me handle two tails, and magma feels good, but little else. I inherited more from my Mother and Father when I ascended, as if I was their born daughter."      

"Your godhood isn't inherited. You took it or made it. I think belief matters to us." She paused dramatically after the statement, then realised she was stating the obvious and laughed warmly. "Well, just feeding. Ever since mortals drinking blood came into the world, I've started craving it myself, that greed is part of me now. But what we think of ourselves and each other may shape us too."     

"Thing is," She sighed and sat up on his legs, pulling his right hand up to feel her brow and face, "You're too curious for me to urge denial. You've been puzzling over this. And I think you might be scared. Gon, I drink blood and eat souls, you don't need to be scared with me."
