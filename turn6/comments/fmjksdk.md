"Prismari... outwitted you?" Gon replied, trying to suppress a laugh and shook his head as he took the polish. He started polishing her body gently, somewhat concerned by the evidence of damage but unable to admit it. After a moment he leaned back and sighed. 

"The short answer is... I don't know." He said quietly with a grown.

He undid unwrapped the bandages to reveal twelve runes that appeared to be carved into grayish brown stone scales. The white scars near to them had taken on the appearance of veins of quartz. They were unfamiliar to Lyva and were different to the old magic texts that she had.

Gon held up his left hand and forearm so that she could see it clearly and continued. "What I do know is that they seem to  have started after my ascension... I think they are marks... perhaps a way to trace me across the void. It feels like something is trying to pull me away."

"On top of that... my dreams... I think they are memories of my life from... before all of this." Gon admitted and returned to polishing Lyva, but avoiding looking in her eyes. He held his left hand away from her, as if afraid of infecting her with whatever it was.
