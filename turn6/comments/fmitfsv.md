Lyva smiled though her eyes widened in utter confusion at Yashqal's appearance, almost dropping from the free before scrambling to catch herself.   

"Ah. Greetings, Yashqal, it's a pleasure, thankyou especially for your great river, it's one of my favourite spots." She breathed and curtsied, sparkling dress rippling around her silver skin.     

"As for your question, a number of things. Firstly, Greed made this world, this planet, and paying back my investment is only right, I put a lot of my hoard into this place. Secondly, they know it's acceptable to want, to desire and to hunger, they know that they can find anything valuable and pursue it. They can hardly gain without Greed." She smiled, a sharklike grin of triangular steel teeth. "And ironically worship is about the only matter that is a Need rather than a Want for me."     

"As for the meeting place, young ones, be warned- gravity is a desire that is hard to fight. It would be easier to meet upon a shining moon than to keep something so vast airborne. Unless you really really want it to be a cloud?" She wondered, immediately curious as to the new gods priorities.
