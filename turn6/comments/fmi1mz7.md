[Vampires will probably try to destroy or damage buildings if they can't enter it, forcing people inside to get out.  
Or they use their minions to get you out. And make sure that you must own it to deny permission.  
Running in to a random shack in the woods and say you don't allow him to enter won't do squat.

They probably also interpited the smallest thing as permission.  
Challenge the vampire? Well, that means he can enter.  
Make the claim that all is welcomed in your halls? well, that includes vampires.]

Azrakal was nearby Urak, looking on him spilling blood.
