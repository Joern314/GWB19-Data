#Crisis: Tiny Problems in the Holy Land

Azrakal was fond of blood, but he wanted it, and now the riders spill blood far less and less as his shrine?  
Unacceptable.  
There needs to set a precedence that all blood letting should be there. It should be a holy ritual, one of strength and *power*.

Azrakal readied himself and called on Sarash, great pain was to be done.

One young man, Urak, a child of a chief started to hear things in his sleep, dreams spoke to him and called him to do some actions.  
He would hunt Strike Wolves in the plains, drag them to the blood shrine and sacrifice them there. He would drink their blood and become more powerful.  
He did this many times.

Soon, by some mysteries reason, his own father was found dead near the shrine. Pale with blood loss, how strange.

He lead his tribe to raid, they struck at the forest men and the city to the west. These attacks however was not killing and looting however, instead, they looted and took prisoner, somewhat unusual for the Riders.

[/u/horatius-cocles and /u/dragoneyecreations, some upstart rider is stealing people  
-2 acts: Contact mortal]

These prisoners were taken to the blood shrine deep in the plains where the chief himself sacrificed them. The other riders were confused by this, these were simple people they captured, they were hardly strong and worthy to have their strength taken.

But as the chief continued, the sky darken around the shrine. The wind took up. Soon, he tortured the prisoners before drawing their blood.

Then, in a huge vat he collected a great amount of blood, he drank it all.

Urak screamed as his body was twisted.  
Fangs grew in his mouth, his nails became like claws and in an instant, his heart stop beating and then started.  
He stood up once more, more powerful than ever before.

The other riders stood in awe, he had spilled blood for the red god, more blood than anyone before him, and he was clearly rewarded.

##Miracle

People chosen by Azrakal can be chosen to become vampires, only way to attract Azrakal's attention is by sacrificing and spilling huge amounts of blood.  
All vampires belongs to a bloodline, each bloodline can have different blessings, the base blessing is as follow:

Base Blessings:  
**Power**: Even a newly turned Vampire is far stronger than a normal mortal  
**Blood Healing**: A vampire, unless burned to ash, will regenerate eventually (bigger injury, more time needed, complete body reconstruction is about a decade).  
**Blood sense**: Able to detect beings with blood all around themselves.  
**Unlife**: A vampire is technically, a unliving, having died but their soul still remains in their body. This means they won't die of old age (but they are no longer mortals, so no worship can benefit from them).  
**Blood kin**: Can pass on the Vampire blessing to another person, this rituals demands magical blood. The new kin lose 10% of the total vampire power. Only a vampire turned by Azrakal himself is at 100% power.  
(first generation is 100%, second 90%, third 80% etc. etc.)

[-22 acts: Base Vampire Bloodline  
higher physical prowress" (3), "slowly regenerate injuries naturally" (3), "survive unless destroyed thoroughly" (5),  "sense blood" (2), "don't age" (6 because regeneration+survival are also there), "don't need food but grow mad if hungry" (3)]

It comes with weakness however:  
All vampires feels the thirst for mortal blood, animal blood does not work.  
Blood healing also consumes blood when healing, making the vampire more thirsty as he heals. The Vampire however, being a mockery of life and death, won't starve to death, but will feel the thirst stronger and stronger to the point of madness.  
A vampire waking up after a decade of healing his destroyed body will pretty much go in to a feral state to find blood to drink.

The First Vampire Bloodline (Urak bloodline):  
**Flight**: They possess wings they can use to fly with, wings can be hidden away.  
**Blood Attunement**: Blood Magic works stronger for them  

[-6 acts: Urak's Bloodline  
(3 for flight, 3 for blood magic boost)]

##Weakness

Now, you might ask: What about weaknesses? Being burned to ash does not sound like a weakness, sounds like a strength to survive anything but that.  
Well, yes.  

I will allow other players to introduce weaknesses to the Vampires, your god might see this blight on existence and go "no, I rather not have mortals be dominated by these super-abominations".  

**Small weakness**: Things that inconvenience the vampire. (ex: Vampire can't cross a line of salt)  (2 acts)  
**Medium weakness**: Things that can injure a vampire or force it to go away, but won't kill it (ex: Holy Symbol + prayer with faith repel and cause pain to vampires) (3 acts)  
**Strong weakness**: Injures a vampire greatly, can be deadly in large quantities (ex: Holy Water burns vampires, the burns will take a decades to heal up) (4 acts)  
**Deadly Weakness**: Can permanently kill a vampire (fairly) easily (ex: wooden stake to the heart) (5 acts)

Let's begin with 1 of each weakness and 2 small weakness? (PS: Prices are subjected to change as per GM decisions (sure, maybe I should have run it pass him first to get the OK signal for all things, but meh, that is for boring people, I also typed all this out on reddit before that idea crossed my mind.)

Also!

##Other Bloodlines

Other players may create other bloodlines, they cost their basic blessing costs (see basic/Uraks bloodline above for example)  
The base cost have been payed by me, you only need to pay the cost for the spesific blessing on the new bloodline.  
Maybe we throw in a 2 acts cost if you want to turn someone behind my back (i.e, without a massive pile of blood sacrifices)

[oi, /u/joern314, you ok with this? Costs can be very easily changed with a single edit.]
