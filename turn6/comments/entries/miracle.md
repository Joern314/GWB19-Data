# Miracle [vampirism]

People chosen by Azrakal can be chosen to become vampires, only way to attract Azrakal's attention is by sacrificing and spilling huge amounts of blood.  
All vampires belongs to a bloodline, each bloodline can have different blessings, the base blessing is as follow:

Base Blessings:  
**Power**: Even a newly turned Vampire is far stronger than a normal mortal  
**Blood Healing**: A vampire, unless burned to ash, will regenerate eventually (bigger injury, more time needed, complete body reconstruction is about a decade).  
**Blood sense**: Able to detect beings with blood all around themselves.  
**Unlife**: A vampire is technically, a unliving, having died but their soul still remains in their body. This means they won't die of old age (but they are no longer mortals, so no worship can benefit from them).  
**Blood kin**: Can pass on the Vampire blessing to another person, this rituals demands magical blood. The new kin lose 10% of the total vampire power. Only a vampire turned by Azrakal himself is at 100% power.  
(first generation is 100%, second 90%, third 80% etc. etc.)

higher physical prowress" (3), "slowly regenerate injuries naturally" (3), "survive unless destroyed thoroughly" (5),  "sense blood" (2), "don't age" (6 because regeneration+survival are also there), "don't need food but grow mad if hungry" (3)]

It comes with weakness however:  
All vampires feels the thirst for mortal blood, animal blood does not work.  
Blood healing also consumes blood when healing, making the vampire more thirsty as he heals. The Vampire however, being a mockery of life and death, won't starve to death, but will feel the thirst stronger and stronger to the point of madness.  
A vampire waking up after a decade of healing his destroyed body will pretty much go in to a feral state to find blood to drink.

The First Vampire Bloodline (Urak bloodline):  
**Flight**: They possess wings they can use to fly with, wings can be hidden away.  
**Blood Attunement**: Blood Magic works stronger for them
