# A Purely Mortal Struggle [None]

Among the young people of Epoidos was one boy. His private name, only his family and friends were allowed to use was Yrdin. To all others he was Ambrosius. Ambrosius was a young Apokryph.

The runic markings on his body had destined him for the Citizen caste. Which meant a life as a tradesman or farmer. 

He underwent his ritual initiation and his innate magical talents were activated by the sacrifice to the Sorcerer. However Ambrosius wanted nothing more than to belong to the caste of Guardians, being a valiant defender of his home and family.

So instead of accepting his lot in life and have his education taken over by the mages and the people of his supposed caste and traveled first south, to the lands of Rictus the god of hunting in hopes of learning the arts of combat from the Waidm√§nner, to prove that he ought to be a Guardian
