In godsight, two things about Gon were immediately noticable; there seemed to be some strands of gold coming from his left forearm and upper thigh where runes seemed to glow a soft gold. These strands or tendrills seemed to just sort of fade into the void. It was as if some of Gon's divinity was being pulled somewhere else. The second noticable thing was that the Retaliator seemed to be lacking in existence. It had been been given the ability to consume souls before and one should perhaps wonder if gods have souls.

All of this would be unknown to Gon who had never learned about godsight or even known it to be a possibility. Being tied to the hero sphere, Kain could also  had a faint sense that the sword had belonged to someone once considered a hero long ago.

"Hrrm I would really appreciate that... It could be very informative... I'll definitely make time." Gon managed as he laughed at Kain's gesture. "Perhaps whatever is happening with me is somehow a longer ranged version of being a demigod... it doesn't quite feel the same..."
