Malaphet watched the serpent ascend from the planet, as he watched most ongoings below on his left-overs below. The ascension itself was not uncommon, he noted this one flying all over the place doing various things. As such he began to relegate more of his attention elsewhere until he noticed her destination wasn't anywhere on the surface but instead on the moon, beyond where the gods interest normally strayed. Curious, Malaphet drew closer to watch, listen, and maybe interact.
