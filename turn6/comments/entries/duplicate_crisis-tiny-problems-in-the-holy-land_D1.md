# Crisis: Tiny Problems in the Holy Land [None]

Thyval was thriving, except for the raids from the barbaric Raiders. And there were numerous bands of exiles who swept out of the Wastes to prod the city. An assault from both sides could not be left unanswered, lest the blessing that was Thyval would fall.

The Rebukers prayed to the Angel to send grace upon them. Be it deliverance from the evils, or the redemption of their plagued hearts, they needed something. *Anything.*

Some grew desperate. Under the cover of night, a small band of acolytes, including the Lord Exalter, had ventured into the Wastes of Pain, begging the exiles to stop their incessant hits against Thyval. In defeat from failed negotiations, they trudged back home, now with a stench of poison on them.

According to the ancient law, they were required to be exiled permanently, but none had known of their endeavors. None except the Angel herself.

Oryllia had to end this. It would weaken both the city and her, this culmination of curse and blessing.

One of the Hallowed-Errant, home from a pilgrimage, had smelled the poison on them, and brought them before the Fair Elders. The guilty acolytes, including the Lord Exalter, were cast out to the Wastes, as according to the ancient law, holy divided from profane once again.
