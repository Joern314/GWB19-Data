[/u/gwydion-drys, I think the civil war happened up there.]

The Blood Cults were angry.  
Cast out from their own homelands for using a power that the proud defenders themselves used.  
Hypocrites.

Raldric had told them of the tales of the red god, a god of strength and war, a god of domination. And the Black Lady, it was clear that their old mistress was the Black Lady.  
They both demanded you train until you bones break, to train until the skin splintered open, to push though the pain.

One man, a leader among the blood cults known as **Derak** had gained much support and he hoped to play this for his own gains.  
He came out, said the red god had spoken to him and that now, he told them of a new land, a land they will call home so they can enact vengeance.

The people cheered for their new leader, their king.

Of course, the same night he was actually visited by the red god, a huge, flayed man, constantly dripping with blood.  
The Red God was pleased with that he had done. He had spilled blood and now he was pulling the strings of an entire population.  
But he only wanted blood, he directed Derak to move to a jungle, there, he would find a weak and pathetic people, he was to enslave them, sacrifice them.

Derak was now somewhat afraid, little did he know the god he claimed to have spoken to him would visit him.

But he did as he could.
