# A Purely Mortal Struggle [None]

Aran wasn't a Warrior. He didn't have the temperament necessary for a life dedicated to the preparation for, and the practice of, battle. He couldn't quite bring himself to look forward to destruction. He would fight and die for his city if he was called upon... but he would never wish to stand upon the walls.

That was fine, of course. The Warrior's Calling was just the most prestigious path a man could walk, not the only path for a man to walk. Aran was fortunate to find that he was immensely qualified for the second most prestigious profession in Gwanyin... that of an Armorsmith.

Aran studied his trade with the same dedication that burned within the Champions of the Order of War. He learned to work with cloth, metal, wood, and leather. He was gifted with a great attention to detail, and a steady hand. 

He prospered in the days leading up to the civil war. His life was comfortable, his health was reinforced by The Essence, and he was fortunate enough to marry one of the Officers of the Guard.

His life was thoroughly shattered by the Blood Cults' Civil War. Aran's wife was killed defending their District. His shop was burned to the ground as the Cults gathered up sacrifices for their strength. He was fortuante enough to escape that fate... for men with skills like his were too valuable to risk in the defense of the city.

Aran hated himself for a time. He believed that he *should* have been fighting, that one more man might have made a difference... if not in the battle as a whole, then in the fight for his wife's life. He cursed the Blood Cults for taking away the idyllic future that had been spread out before him... the children and grandchildren he would never see. The woman he would never hold again.

In the end... Aran's anger turned towards Gwanyin's culture. He came to *hate* how much the city valued Strength, and saw that as the root of the Civil War. Men had become murderers to grow stronger, and torn lives apart in the process. *Something* needed to change... and Aran had an idea for how the city he loved could be changed and the next war might be prevented.
