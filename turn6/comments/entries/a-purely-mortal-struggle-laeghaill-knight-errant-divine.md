# A Purely Mortal Struggle - Laeghaill, Knight-Errant Divine [None]

That ashen blonde boy always spoke with kindness and honor, like he was born with a pious tongue. Others said he was exemplary of the Angel, that he was the kindest and most loving child to grace the city. So much so that he sought to enter into the Holy Order of the Starlit Saint

Laeghaill had been a faithful Cleric-Knight for the Beloved Angel for years. He never expected everything to be taken away from him in an instant.

Beggars they were called, and all he and Reyla knew to do was to extend grace towards them. And now she lied there, blood staining her sky-blue dress like crimson clouds.

*Why would they do this if they knew they would receive help?* Laeghaill's gripped his amulet tightly. He could feel the four wings outstretched from the flaming star. It thrummed with his fury.

*Dearest beloved Angel, if you hear me, forgive me of these curses that I breed. I know you can redeem the deepest sins, so show me your grace. But blood must be paid with blood.*
