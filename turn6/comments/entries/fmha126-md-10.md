# None [None]

One young man, Urak, a child of a chief started to hear things in his sleep, dreams spoke to him and called him to do some actions.  
He would hunt Strike Wolves in the plains, drag them to the blood shrine and sacrifice them there. He would drink their blood and become more powerful.  
He did this many times.

Soon, by some mysteries reason, his own father was found dead near the shrine. Pale with blood loss, how strange.

He lead his tribe to raid, they struck at the forest men and the city to the west. These attacks however was not killing and looting however, instead, they looted and took prisoner, somewhat unusual for the Riders.

These prisoners were taken to the blood shrine deep in the plains where the chief himself sacrificed them. The other riders were confused by this, these were simple people they captured, they were hardly strong and worthy to have their strength taken.

But as the chief continued, the sky darken around the shrine. The wind took up. Soon, he tortured the prisoners before drawing their blood.

Then, in a huge vat he collected a great amount of blood, he drank it all.

Urak screamed as his body was twisted.  
Fangs grew in his mouth, his nails became like claws and in an instant, his heart stop beating and then started.  
He stood up once more, more powerful than ever before.

The other riders stood in awe, he had spilled blood for the red god, more blood than anyone before him, and he was clearly rewarded.
