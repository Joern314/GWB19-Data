# None [None]
*Meanwhile, in the Timestream...*

Dawri was catapulted through time and space, having fired off rather poorly across the strings of Fate. Of course, this wasn't Dawri's first trip through the Timestream, so he wasn't exactly fucked. However, he was a bit lost, adrift at sea, is you will. Which put him way off his intended course. However, he was not entirely removed from the Prime. There was a tether, somehow.

So, Dawri did what was roughly the equivalent of building paper airplanes out of Divine Power, and tossing them at the Prime Material Plane, with some built-in commands that would "detonate" upon landing in the Prime. One was a prophetic blessing, as a warning for a couple alterations to the landscape and ecosystem. Hell, if he was lucky, he wouldn't be too far behind.

So, as he was catapulted through time, he noticed a reoccurring celestial object, some sort of meteor or comet, was supposed to be the end of all life in some great cataclysm. It was, interestingly, pointed in the right direction...

So, Dawri leapt from his thread in the Timestream, crashing onto the comet's surface. And just like that, he was riding the comet through all of time and space, as he dragged the comet through time with him.

He noticed that if he let the collision transpire, he'd likely eradicate all life on the Prime, which would probably piss all the gods off, forcing them to start from scratch. Very not nice. So, he placed his hand on the comet, and prepared to rip it from the Timestream entirely, the moment he was within the Prime.

Dawri saw the Prime approaching, passing through the veil of Malaphet. Dawri tensed, gripping the comet tight as he took a deep breath, preparing for the pull. And then, just before the comet collided with the Prime, Dawri ripped the comet out of Time, causing the massive comet to suddenly stop.

However, Dawri was still moving at several machs, and as such, shot from the frozen comet and slammed into the earth. Being a god, he was fine, but he left a fairly significant crater, which took him some time to crawl from. He groaned and dusted himself off, before looking around. He clearly had lost quite a bit of time... but it was fine. Clearly, the crowd of frightened mortals at the edge of the landmass meant that his messages had landed.

Ahh, he remembered, he had something planned for this. He'd intended its insertion to be more... theatrical, but he was on a tight schedule. He removed a rectangular pouch from his belt, and opened it, removing from it a deck of cards.

He turned them over, flipping through them, making sure they were all accounted for. On their backs was an elaborate, flowing black-and-white design, several sets of rings interlocked surrounding a blooming rose. On their fronts were artistic depictions of various beings, in some surreal environment, along with a number and a name. Once Dawri nodded, convinced, he swung out his hands, and the cards strategically placed themselves in two semicircles, twenty-two in the inner, fifty-six in the outer.

Rising out from each card was a radiant, ethereal spirit, mostly humanoids, all glowing a different color, often with elaborate outfits, armor, or bodies, their forms corresponding with the entities in the cards. As they fully rose from their cards, the spirits began to stretch and crick their necks, if they had them.

"It's about damn time you let us out of the box, Dawri!" a tall, scarred woman covered in metal spikes snarled.

"Is it really a 'box' if it's not rigid?" a jester with a porcelain mask replied.

"I suppose you could interpret any container as a box, if you interpret it as a metaphorical, symbolic box." chimed a hooded figure, inky-black tentacles wriggling from beneath the cowl.

"Forget I said anything." the scarred woman stated.

Dawri clasped his hands together with a smile, looking around at the crowd of ghostly beings.

"Alright, ladies, gentlemen, genderfluid shapeshifters, and agender eldritch entities, welcome back to the Prime Material Plane! I'm sure you all know the deal: find an individual worthy of your mantle, grant them your blessings, and... be sure to make an interesting story..."

A fiendish, horned, hermaphroditic being with claws and fur grinned with its maw of sharp teeth, spreading its arms and tilting its head towards the sky.

"Ahh, this will be better than that time you handed us over to that stone-faced soldier-boy. Will you let us have a bit of fun this time?"

Dawri's grin grew as he leaned in.

"That is *entirely* for you to decide."

A warrior in golden armor raised his spear to the sky triumphantly.

"Oh, what glories we shall revel in! Huzzah!"

Dawri flicked wrists in a dismissing gesture as he chuckled.

"Alright, run along, now. You have business to attend to!"

The spirits then shot skyward along with their cards, which momentarily blazed in the sky like small suns, before scattering to the horizons. Dawri smiled as they departed. Now, he just had to wait... Perhaps the other gods would decide to pay him a visit.
