# A purely mortal struggle I [None]

The Iron Law was a fact, one that didn't go away. For many criminals this meant going away and setting up shop elsewhere. For the dumb ones this meant business as usual until the eye of an Iron Judge was caught and a verdict rendered. But for Udeis it was his playing ground.

Udeis had grown up in the forest, like everyone in the Hunting Grounds, as all of it was one giant forest. He had trained in hunting, traded his hunted goods, under the tutelage of his father. That was until a bear mauled said father. Udeis' mother unable to provide for all the children alone needed to resort to selling the only thing she could to finance their lives. 

Prostitution was not exactly illegal under Iron Law but came with heavy restrictions. Udeis appreciated his mother for bringing that sacrifice for her family. And he decided to do his part. He stole food or clothes, learned how to sneak and speak in order to talk people out of their money or spirit it out of their purses. And as he got more skilled he learned to relish the challenge.

The Iron Law just meant a “good” criminal had to be smart, skilled and careful. And Udeis learned to be all of those things. All of his young life was a game of cat and mouse between him and the servants of Rictus.
