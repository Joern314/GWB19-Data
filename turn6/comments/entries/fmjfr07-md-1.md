Prismari noticing a growing amount of gods in space decided to investigate moving as fast as he could so malaphet didnâ€™t try to eat him 

Upon making it to the moon he was over joyed to find an atmosphere finally a safe place in space... compared to the rest of space anyway 

He the saw an amphitheater on the moon... he smiled gleefully and then drawing on past memories began building a large strange  twisted tower of Cyclopean masonry made of colourful crystal standing four hundred and forty three meters high 

At the second floor from the was a large throne room  with thrones fit for each and every one for ever god, these thrones surrounded a vast crystal globe 

Upon the roof was a viewing platform facing  the planet upon which even more throne one for each god again 

Prismari him self closed off the third floor from the top for his own personal living space along with a train room and other odd features that he seemed to like
