# The Lunar Congregation [None]

Somewhat impatient, Lyva left the crater and tree behind, darting up into her gargantuan serpentine dragon self to slither up and  roam over the moons surface. It felt good, solid, and 99.999% not bout to turn out to be some monster's egg, so she determined the light side of it and set to work.       
There was no atmosphere, and so any water would freeze instantly, but Lyva decided to great a great moat of Mercury around a central "island". The chasm was several miles long and light reflecting off the mirror-like metal would be visible from the planet, letting mortals eventually discover their realm. It was also, coincidentally, a very comfortable fit for her to nap in.    

[-2 Acts to Terraform a large circular chasm, so any moon-builders have a big circular plateau to build on or around.]
