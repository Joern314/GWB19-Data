Gon would find kain on the second continent not far from the Nkarlen shaped mountain it had been his base of operations sense his argument with Prismari 

When he heard someone approached he yelled “GOOO AWAY LYVA I DONT CARE WHAT PRISMARI SAID IM NOT LETTING YOU CUT OFF MY LEGS.... oh hello gon, don’t mind my outburst... I’m kind of on the outs with those two at the moment.” Kain said rather truthfully 

He then looked over Gon, perhaps something was wrong... maybe he should help raced through his mind “ is there anything you need help with my younger friend ?” Kain asked with a smile, at least gon was here to yell at him like Prismari has been doing
