Mair answered the Sorcerer's invitation when the Civil War broke out in their Holy Land.

They were not entirely displeased by the violence. Mair did not care for high-brow issues of philosophy or morality. They only cared for the Passion that drove men to survive and *fight* to shape the world... and both sides had that passion.

One side valued Strength above all else. The other side valued Stability. This conflict would answer their debate. The side that won would be the side whose beliefs made them stronger. Mair saw no reason to interfere.
