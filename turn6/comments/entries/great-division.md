[Tiny Problems in the Holy Land]

[/u/Plintstorm]

The Art of Blood-Enhancement nearly destroyed the City of Gwanyin, and the Reborn Kingdom.

The Secret of Blood Enhancement could not remain a secret forever... and Raldric's Gift inevitably leaked beyond the confines of the Order of Life's Priests. Some even said that Raldric himself had shared the secret with the common people. The result... was as inevitable as it was tragic.

The Highest Virtues in Gwanyin were Martial Prowess and Strength. Blood Enhancement offered an easier path to the latter. Most of those who would come to abuse the Art *first* focused their efforts against Beasts, seeking to hunt and gain strength from them. Yet... there was an easier source within the walls of Gwanyin. The City's Laborers were strong men and women, hardened by labor... and that strength could be stolen from their blood.

These men began to kill in secret... but their actions could not remain hidden for long. The Laborers' Absence was noticed by the Order of Life. Guards were sent to investigate... and many of them went missing as well. Eventually the Order of War was set to the task of investigating the disappearances... and they discovered that Blood Enhancement was being abused.
