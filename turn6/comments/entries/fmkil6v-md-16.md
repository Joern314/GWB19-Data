# None [None]

The War began soon afterwards. There were charismatic leaders among those who had learned of Blood Enhancement, and they began to share their knowledge with their followers. These Blood Cults turned the City's Strength against it... turning a series of riots into a war.

The City's District Walls were *meant* to provide redundant layers of defense. An Invading Army would have to fight a long campaign through the city if they were to attempt an assault. They would have to seize control over individual segments of the wall, pacify the district beyond that wall, and then do it again *multiple times* before they reached the Well of Life.

The Walls proved to be a double-edged sword when the Enemy came from within the city itself. The Blood Cults were forewarned of their doom by a traitor within the Guard... and so they rose up. They did the unthinkable, using their knowledge of the City's Defenses and their Training *for* its defense to take the walls, and hold them against the Guard and the Order of War.

Thus began the long and painful war. It first looked like it would be over quickly. The Blood Cults fought each-other as much as they fought The Guard. But... they did not remain discordant for long. Raldric betrayed the Order of War, and joined with the Blood Cults. He invoked a religious fervor in their hearts, uniting the Blood Cults beneath his banner. He was one of the finest Champions of the Order of War... and he knew how his Brothers thought.

Thus, the War would not be quick. It would not be easy. It lasted for over a year of brutal urban fighting... until the Blood Cults were forced out of the city by its defenders. They would go on to found another nation... one that would be a thorn in the side of the reborn kingdom for much of history.

[The rest is up to you, Plint.]
