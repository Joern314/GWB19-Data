The Warriors were members of the Order of War. Each knew the touch of death better than that of their lovers, for they courted it in every day of training. They pushed their bodies past the point of breaking, only to be restored to health by Life Essence.

The Strange Warrior had won a *rare* prize in the battle. He had stood strong against *three* Champions of the Order of War... *despite* being wounded. The Champions credited most of his success to his cunning symbiosis, for the strange creature he rode upon gave him a *decisive* advantage in mobility and speed. However... they could not deny that he had unusual strength.

When he paused in battle, and asked his question... the Champions saw it as an opportunity to learn, and perhaps to expand their order's ranks and expand their arsenal.

"We know not of what you speak," a Champion said, "our Strength is won through suffering. We train each day until we feel the touch of Death... and through that we grow strong."
