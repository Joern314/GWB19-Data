# Weakness [vampirism]

Now, you might ask: What about weaknesses? Being burned to ash does not sound like a weakness, sounds like a strength to survive anything but that.  
Well, yes.  

I will allow other players to introduce weaknesses to the Vampires, your god might see this blight on existence and go "no, I rather not have mortals be dominated by these super-abominations".  

**Small weakness**: Things that inconvenience the vampire. (ex: Vampire can't cross a line of salt)  (2 acts)  
**Medium weakness**: Things that can injure a vampire or force it to go away, but won't kill it (ex: Holy Symbol + prayer with faith repel and cause pain to vampires) (3 acts)  
**Strong weakness**: Injures a vampire greatly, can be deadly in large quantities (ex: Holy Water burns vampires, the burns will take a decades to heal up) (4 acts)  
**Deadly Weakness**: Can permanently kill a vampire (fairly) easily (ex: wooden stake to the heart) (5 acts)

Let's begin with 1 of each weakness and 2 small weakness? (PS: Prices are subjected to change as per GM decisions (sure, maybe I should have run it pass him first to get the OK signal for all things, but meh, that is for boring people, I also typed all this out on reddit before that idea crossed my mind.)

Also!
