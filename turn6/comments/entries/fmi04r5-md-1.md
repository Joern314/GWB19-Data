Lyva was fascinated, she could sense the endless hunger contained here, the seeds sown, though the methods employed were not to her liking. She watched him for a few days, watching the raids and brutality, it was all so messy and savage. And so she laid a curse on their kind, that they would need owners permission to enter homes and towns, that he could not simply ride in but his foes could prepare and meet him head on. A Vampire which enters property without permission becomes far weaker, their strength a fraction of a normal mortals.         

That done, she decided to go and see the maker of the breed, searching for Azrakel as she felt this new hunger in her being.
