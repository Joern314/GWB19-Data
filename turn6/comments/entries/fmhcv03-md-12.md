# None [None]

Thus, the Orders of the Temple of Life embarked upon an experiment to see if Blood Empowerment could be put to use in the *preservation* of the Order's Strength across generations. 

A Recruit for the Order was found among the City-State's Officers, and he began to train in their Shadow. He was not granted the Essence, and so he could not face the Trials of the Champions... but he was *prepared* to join them.

The next time the Healers of the Order of Life judged that a Champion was beyond their power to save, they did not cast him into the Vortex as was tradition. Instead, they summoned the Recruit secreted the Warrior away to a room within the Temple. The Recruit smashed the Champion's brain in with his hammer, giving him the peace of death and sparing him the indignity of being Undying... and gathered up the Champion's Blood.

He performed the Ritual of Blood Empowerment... and drank in the strength of his predecessor.
