# None [None]
"You can do that?!" Gon exclaimed in surprise before internally lamenting not asking Lyva about the perks of being a full divinity, other than the obvious ones. He had always felt out the changes laid on the world by the metaphysics as if it was some kind of instinct. Distracted by this idea and trying to figure out how to do it, he paid little attention to what Kain was doing.

The blade seemed to ripple strangely before offering up any information. Kain could feel that there was a connection to more than one hero who had been considered heroes. The first was Nek, who had summoned the blade during the slave wars, but that was something Kain likely already knew about. Before that he could tell that there was a long stretch where the blade had no connection to any heroes. Even further back he could feel that a hero had indeed wielded it. The trace of that story was faint, perhaps from the very beginning of the blades existence. The first thing he could tell from that period was that the blade was associated very heavily with a particular leader, and that the blade was called something different.

One thing that was certain was that the hero was not Gon.
