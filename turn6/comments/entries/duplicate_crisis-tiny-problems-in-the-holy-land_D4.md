# Crisis: Tiny Problems in the Holy Land [None]

The city of Epoidos was in real danger of losing its edge on the forefront of magic. Many of its best mages wandered to offer their services to highest bidder. Prime example was the civil war brewing on Secundus, the second continent. Amalah had been split right down the middle by the arrival of a blood rider from Primus. 

The brewing conflict necessitated a wealth of weapons, armor and of course magic. The mages of Epoidos were the best in the world. They knew all the theurgic cantrips and the enhancing runes of the Sorcerer.

The Sorcerer of course took notice of this. He clad himself in a mock mortal form, an avatar. He assumed the role of the Vir Sacra and claimed to be his own prophet. To solidify  Epoidos' cutting age talents in magic, he taught the Apokryph of the White Gates Necrurgy.

With the power to transplant a bit of knowledge, skill and ability from one soul to another, it  cut the time the mages of Epoidos needed to train essentially in half.
