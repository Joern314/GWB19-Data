# Mortal Struggle I [None]

Motley was a young jumbled. He had been sewn together by his mom and dad a few years prior. Like all boys/ girls (Motley could never decide and it often changed with time of day) in the body of a human man, with a little Apokryph woman mixed in, Motley thought there needed to be more to live than wasting away on a mountain, herding goats and spend time living in “harmony with nature”.

So one day after confronting his parents, (He decided to be a boy for this, because for whatever reason his parents seemed to think boys could take better care of themselves, though he couldn't see it, especially if he was in a she phase. He barely could see it in one of his he phases either.) he packed a small pack. It contained the necessities for all jumbled, a set of clothes to change and good bone needles and a large quantity of string. Of course Motley also brought food.

Motley wandered of the mountain, through the woods at its base. Whenever she ran into another jumbled she greeted them and walked on. Only few strangers ever came to the mountain. Most of them had been crippled and hoped the jumbled could mend them. Most that came went when they found out that the jumbled only could sew the body parts of someone else onto their bodies in lieu of making new ones from scratch. Motley didn't get that mindset. He and she preferred working limbs over non-existant limbs. And sewing together limbs were how children were made after all.

Motley (Decidedly she now. Her mom was always the more social one and knew how to talk to people, so Motley decided to borrow something of that aspect of her mom's personality.) talked to herself and was practicing talking to imaginary humans, goblins or Apokryph. She had seen more of those than any other race. Once in a while a soul collector came through taking away the souls of those that had passed away to the afterlife. 

Her parents had been worried about Motley striking out on her own. But after getting a priest of Glypha to bless her, they were willing to let her go explore as long as she promised to come back eventually. Motley took the blessing and wandered off. The goddess had undoubtedly made her people, or so the priests claimed, but from the few strangers she had met she had heard of many other gods. Which in the end had spawned her interest to see more of the world.
