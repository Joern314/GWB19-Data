# None [None]
Raldric proved himself to have the mental fortitude necessary to train as a member of the Order of War. He endured the trials, and *earned* his supply of the Life Essence.

He earned his place in Legend by sharing his Knowledge with the Order, just as the Order shared its Knowledge with him. The Order had no concept of Cavalry before Raldric came to them... but his horses and his knowledge provided the foundation upon which Dernasian Cavalry could be built.

In return, Raldric gained the knowledge he had lacked. His skill as a horseman was unquestioned... but his deficiencies on foot were laid bare by the Order of War. His training focused upon his weaknesses, seeking to break him of bad habits and teach him to stand in battle without a horse to hold him up.

Raldric brought another tool to Gwanyin: Blood Empowerment.

The Order of War saw Blood Empowerment as a path to easy power... one that could easily become a force of self-destruction if circulated widely within their society. Thus, they did what they could to contain Raldric's Art, ensuring that the knowledge was kept within their ranks. Although it was a dangerous secret... it also offered them a form of Immortality, a means to continue to Defend the Well and Gwanyin from beyond the grave.
