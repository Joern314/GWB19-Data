# Crisis: Tiny Problems in the Holy Land [None]

Azrakal was fond of blood, but he wanted it, and now the riders spill blood far less and less as his shrine?  
Unacceptable.  
There needs to set a precedence that all blood letting should be there. It should be a holy ritual, one of strength and *power*.

Azrakal readied himself and called on Sarash, great pain was to be done.
