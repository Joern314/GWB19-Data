# None [None]

The War with the goblins were not a great one, they were far stronger than any goblin could ever hope to be, they enslaved them, killed them in blood rituals to the red god.  
They had the slaves construct a city for them, acting as labor. Centered around one of the rivers in the jungle.  
They called this city **Redgash**

They would go out, kill mighty and powerful beasts and drink their blood, enslave the beasts and train them, they would be useful in the war to come.

And in a grand ritual, Derak had so many goblins sacrifised in one night that the blood poured down the temple on to the ground, and he was transformed.  
People looked on his new blessed form and knew the red god was with them.

Derak, now a vampire declared that they were now the **Vengeful**, and they would have vengeance.
