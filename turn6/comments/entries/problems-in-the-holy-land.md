# Problems in the Holy Land [None]

Not many but some jumbled had left and left and returned on a regular basis to the mountain. They were the jumbled trading their crafts for body parts the jumbled used to sew their offspring with. Though as per divine decree the jumbled lived simple lives on their mountain, word of the cities and their luxuries spread.

It started with the import of luxury wares and tools. Then came the knowledge. The jumbled remembered the words of their goddess to live simple lives and be better than the other mortals. Two schools of thought emerged among the jumbled.

The technologists wanted to adopt all city knowledge and use it to make live easier. The traditionalists were strictly against it, citing a need to comply with their creator's will. And while disputes between the elders raged on live continued anyway.

For now everything stay relatively the same as the elders had not settled on a definitive answer. Live on the mountain would be interesting in any case.
