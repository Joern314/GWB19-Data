Kain began laughing, it seemed the two haven’t gotten around to telling gon yet “ yes ! She wants to cut off my legs, something about Prismari promising it’s over a bet that he then cheated on .... either way I don’t care what my son said... no one is cutting off my legs.” Kain said looking around thinking this might be a trap 

Kain then tugged at his   And prismari incorporeal bound only visible under godsight 

“ I suppose where your asking lyva and the boy haven’t gotten around to telling you, prismari is my son ... so I’ll do the short version... I lost him long  ago.... I have only just found him in the last world you where all where in and by luck I found him nearly dead in the void.... being my son... my blood I was able to combine are divinity so he could live and I could have my son back.... but I didn’t have the nerve to tell him who I was.... I suppose you care more about the incorporeal bound “ kain said with a shrug 

“ oh in all honesty, I’m not positive how it works,  to tie two separate divinities together is a tricky process and I only tried it for I had nothing to lose... it’s no where near as easy as bounding a demigod.” Can said giving a short explanation
