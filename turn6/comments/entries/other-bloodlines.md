# Other Bloodlines [vampirism]

Other players may create other bloodlines, they cost their basic blessing costs (see basic/Uraks bloodline above for example)  
The base cost have been payed by me, you only need to pay the cost for the spesific blessing on the new bloodline.  
Maybe we throw in a 2 acts cost if you want to turn someone behind my back (i.e, without a massive pile of blood sacrifices)
