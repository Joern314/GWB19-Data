Come night time, or what passed for night time, Lyva appeared in the room, or more precisely, in the forge, looking around blearily as if just awoken.    

"Oh... that's why it felt like there was a forge here." She blinked, taking in the shelves of books, the new winged form, and the chairs and familiar hammer. She seemed to try to scowl, but just yawned as she mumbled, "Oryllia. You're here. Hello. This is nice and warm."     

That said, she curled up in the burning coals, seeming to decide it was more comfortable than leaving.
