Yashqal took off after Lyva. He re-entered the void for the first time in thousands of years. Memories flooded back to him as the cool nothingness enveloped his many limbs. He admired the shimmering ring that created some definition on the barren surface.  

Yashqal's first concern was a space for performance, he thought, 

"without an atmosphere this is no place for music, but that won't stop me from dancing." 

He dug his claws into the earth and pulled up a modest red-rock amphitheater from the ground. The front row contained spectator boxes with 18 thrones, one for each god he had ever heard of. 

"This will make a fine space for divine gossip."

Then Yashqal hollowed out the space under the seating and secured a nice apartment for himself, one with a fine view of the glimmering river.
