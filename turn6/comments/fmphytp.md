Gon watched the process with a genuine smile. It was a fascinating technique and he always enjoyed magic. He let the Sorcerer finish his current spell before greeting him.

"Hello there, you are the one called the Sorcerer, correct? I tried visiting you at home but here you are wielding magic amongst mortals." 

"That is an interesting technique. Are you able to pick and choose skills and memories, or is it mostly useful for passing on general experience? Can you see the memories and skills or only the person you pass them onto. Selective transfer would certainly permit interesting ways to manipulate a person's opinions. Are there after effects? Will they know who they are? What if you transfer a more memories than they have?" Gon asked enthusiastically, unable to resist. He shook in an attempt to focus.

"Wait, wait... I came for a different reason. Lyva said you had traveled the void, and Panoptes confirm that. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?"
