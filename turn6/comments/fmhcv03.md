Raldric proved himself to have the mental fortitude necessary to train as a member of the Order of War. He endured the trials, and *earned* his supply of the Life Essence.

He earned his place in Legend by sharing his Knowledge with the Order, just as the Order shared its Knowledge with him. The Order had no concept of Cavalry before Raldric came to them... but his horses and his knowledge provided the foundation upon which Dernasian Cavalry could be built.

In return, Raldric gained the knowledge he had lacked. His skill as a horseman was unquestioned... but his deficiencies on foot were laid bare by the Order of War. His training focused upon his weaknesses, seeking to break him of bad habits and teach him to stand in battle without a horse to hold him up.

Raldric brought another tool to Gwanyin: Blood Empowerment.

The Order of War saw Blood Empowerment as a path to easy power... one that could easily become a force of self-destruction if circulated widely within their society. Thus, they did what they could to contain Raldric's Art, ensuring that the knowledge was kept within their ranks. Although it was a dangerous secret... it also offered them a form of Immortality, a means to continue to Defend the Well and Gwanyin from beyond the grave.

Thus, the Orders of the Temple of Life embarked upon an experiment to see if Blood Empowerment could be put to use in the *preservation* of the Order's Strength across generations. 

A Recruit for the Order was found among the City-State's Officers, and he began to train in their Shadow. He was not granted the Essence, and so he could not face the Trials of the Champions... but he was *prepared* to join them.

The next time the Healers of the Order of Life judged that a Champion was beyond their power to save, they did not cast him into the Vortex as was tradition. Instead, they summoned the Recruit secreted the Warrior away to a room within the Temple. The Recruit smashed the Champion's brain in with his hammer, giving him the peace of death and sparing him the indignity of being Undying... and gathered up the Champion's Blood.

He performed the Ritual of Blood Empowerment... and drank in the strength of his predecessor.

In time, the Order's Structure changed to embrace this new advantage. The number of Warriors in the Order of War was set at fifty, no more and no less. 

The Order of Battle was then created to prepare recruits for the Order of War. Their Training was more grueling than what was given to lesser soldiers... but not as agonizing as that which produced the Champions of the Order of War.

When the time came for a member of the Order of War to die, it was to be by the hand of the strongest member of the Order of Battle that was on hand. That member of the Order of Battle would then drink in the strength of their predecessor, and take their place in the Order of War. The identity of the Warrior who would next join the Order of War was a carefully guarded secret, held only by the Order of Life... to ensure that ambitious warriors would not seek to slaughter their betters in order to advance.
