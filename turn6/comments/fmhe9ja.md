"Warriors, ha!" Sunda grunted, looking at the land that Mair had claimed. "I'll show them warriors."

It resembled a tiger, as that had been the animal he'd begun with. Large bat-like wings, done in the same striped pattern, rested on its back. Not enough for true flight of course, but enough to glide from treetops and clifftops.

The paws, both hind and fore, had to be redone. More dexterous, with claws designed to pierce stone, so that they could scale cliff and tree.

Their tails were built anew, now tipped with a spear-tip like piece of bone, one that was covered in sharp ridges.

"These should test them fine enough." he muttered, turning his new creations loose. That done he whispered in the minds of the locals, told them that the Wild Lord had seen their skill and prowess and had sent them a challenge worthy of their skill.
