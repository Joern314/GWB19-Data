Dead and dying people and animals often carry skills or training that would be wasted with the dead. A mage capable of necrurgy can remove parts of the soul from a recently dead person or animal and implant them in a living person or animal. 

In people memories of the deceased or dying often will be transported alongside the skill or ability the mage wants to transplant. 

In animals, character traits are often transferred. So the ferocity of one animal might be transferred onto another.

This is the drawback of this magic if it is misused, employed too often on the same target or performed badly, Necrurgy can lead to mental illness, most often multiple personality disorder. (5 acts for magic + 2 for secret)
