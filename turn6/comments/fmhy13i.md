##Lyvkerel Grows    

As time passed, the city of Lyvkerel grew to dominate the southern coast of the great Kiln Island, as a mass of huts and buildings often designed with competitive complexity by rival artisans. Most who lived in the city by this point were born there, with less immigration to the great confusion, and only dedicated metal workers coming to seek tuition and learning.    

Some of these were humans from the mainland who desired to learn to work the Kiln Forge and produce enchanted items, only to be denied by the Apokyph Masters of the forge for they had no life marking, no caste and little skill with magic. In their fury at being denied such, even with their skills, and the complacency of the city, the humans decided it was time that Lyvkerel itself should be reforged. Fuses were hidden, oil was spilled, and one night, much of Lyvkerel was immersed in swathes of flame.     

Being built of wood and mushroom common to the isles, the city was devastated, forges destroyed, stocks laid bare, and many Apokryphs died. It did not take long for fingers of blame to be pointed, and in the aftermath, the Iron Judges found the arsonists, seeking to claim that Lyva had burnt the city for their idleness. Their lies failed them, and in wrath, it was decided that the arsonists ought to be sacrificed to the ForgeMother for their crimes, thrown into the burning fires of her volcanic forge.    

Yet upon doing so, the mountain began to rumble, the island shook, and Lyva decided to repay their gift with a present of her own. Once more, comets of strange metals flew from the Kiln Islands, and formed within its earth for miners to seek. Some were new, enchanted substances, while others were discovered to be combinations of other metals, alloys with unique properties.    

With the gifts and the devastation of the city, Lyvkerel was actually reforged and reinvigorated, rebuilt again of lasting stone with hotter fires and metal decorations, never to be burned away again.
