#Prompt: A Purely Mortal Struggle I

His name was Raldric

He had rode, raided, herded, eaten.  
All his life in the blood plains.

He had seen his fellow riders die to the Iron Judges and the hunters of the forests, how they could only raid at the outskirts of the forest, how the big city hide behind it's walls and coward, yet no horse could climb it.

There must be a way to become stronger, most riders focus so much on mounted combat that when they step off their horses, they become much weaker.  
Sure, on the open plain the riders are unbeatable, but few stay out there.

So he left, he took his personal horses with him, some deer to feed him on the trip and left.

He ventured far and wide to find other way to battle and gain strength, the Red God wanted blood, and blood he would get.  
He knew he could not gain the strength of the forest people, no rider would ever accept them anyway and no forest dweller would accept him.

He ventured far until he meet with the great blue, so big and far, far beyond what he could know.  
He encountered a wooden house on the blue, a ship they called it, he said he wanted passage far away and thus, after paying with his deer meat and hide, he got passage for him and his horses.  
He was not leaving them behind, he could not call himself a rider if he did.

Raldric did not take the sea travel well, the great blue waved back and forth and he vomited many times.

Eventually, they struck land and he departed.

This land was strange, many mountains made it harder to ride but soon, he came by people.

Naturally, he stole everything they had. Raldric figured it was the best way to get the strongest to come to him.  
He did not kill any, he would need not to fight to the death, just to talk.

Soon. Warriors showed up they battled, struck back and forth but Raldric had his trusted horse. He was faster than the warriors could ever hope to be and Raldric was adapt at mounted battle.  

But the warriors was strong, after Raldric killed five of them, he noticed he was injured. He let the last get away.  
He tried to bandage his wounds up and get some rest.

but a day later, some more warriors showed up, these one looked far harder than the first ones.  
Raldric was injured, bleeding but he still rode out to meet them in battle.

It was a tough battle. None of them died and then Raldric stopped.  
The warriors was unsure.

And Raldric spoke

"Your blood must be strong, have you drunk deep from other warriors? Or strong beasts of the land?"  
The Warriors just looked confused at each other...
