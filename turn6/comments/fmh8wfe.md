Raldric was breathing heavily, clearly, the battle had tired him out, but he was still standing (or sitting?) on his horse.

"Strength by suffering?  
Ah, you are acolytes of the Black Lady?   
I follow the Red God myself. While I know much of the strength of blood, the strength of suffering have not touched my mind."

Raldric pulled himself up a bit after slumping a bit in his horse. He was clearly somewhat injured.

"Can you tell me of this teaching of the Black Lady? It be a shame to only have the teaching of the Red God as a Blood Rider."
