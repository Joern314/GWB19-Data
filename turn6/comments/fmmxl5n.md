**The Struggle of Idren I**

On the edges of the Great Kiln Island, Idren was born to a clan of farmers known as the Estkin, Apokyphs who farmed the larger fungi of the islands using waste and dung. Seeking to escape such a life, his father handed the property over to this brother in order to move into the great city of Lyvkerel seeking greater opportunities. Smiths and mages were well regarded, and Idren's life markings were unlike those of his parents, so the family hoped that in time he might be appointed as a mage or philosopher. In the meantime, they worked hard as servants to a great smith, maintaining and pumping his forge and dwelling in a hovel alongside it.

Tragedy struck when the great fire of Lyvkerel was begun by arsonists, and much of the city caught blaze. Idren found himself lost within a hellscape quickly, as those who suffocated amidst smoke rose once more as ravenous unliving, and then exploded and spread more fire across the city when they fell. His mother fell to a falling beam, becoming a scrounging ravenous monster trapped in place. His father fell driving a chisel into the head of another unliving, engulfed and sent to rest by the ensuing blast.

When the smoke cleared, Idren found himself somehow alive, having managed to scamper through the wreckage and rubble to safety. He was scarred, life-markings burnt in places as to be unreadable, and his mind far more so.

How could the great parents allow such tragedy to befall them? Why did the Sorcerer, Father of his kind, wish for him to see family and neighbours turn to shambling feral monsters? Why would the Forgemother Lyva burn her children? In the coming weeks, priests spoke of reforging, of the trial making the city stronger and hotter, but the orphaned apokryph had nothing of his peoples gods.

Instead he found his way to the docks and heard of the Goddess of water, a Goddess who took what she wanted and gave nothing back. Such seemed fair to the boy, and soon he fell amongst pickpockets, a small fishhook in his ear as a token of the Knave, and a reminder of what he ultimately desired- he would never become one of the shambling unliving. He would claim Immortality.
