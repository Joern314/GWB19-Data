###A purely mortal struggle I

The Iron Law was a fact, one that didn't go away. For many criminals this meant going away and setting up shop elsewhere. For the dumb ones this meant business as usual until the eye of an Iron Judge was caught and a verdict rendered. But for Udeis it was his playing ground.

Udeis had grown up in the forest, like everyone in the Hunting Grounds, as all of it was one giant forest. He had trained in hunting, traded his hunted goods, under the tutelage of his father. That was until a bear mauled said father. Udeis' mother unable to provide for all the children alone needed to resort to selling the only thing she could to finance their lives. 

Prostitution was not exactly illegal under Iron Law but came with heavy restrictions. Udeis appreciated his mother for bringing that sacrifice for her family. And he decided to do his part. He stole food or clothes, learned how to sneak and speak in order to talk people out of their money or spirit it out of their purses. And as he got more skilled he learned to relish the challenge.

The Iron Law just meant a “good” criminal had to be smart, skilled and careful. And Udeis learned to be all of those things. All of his young life was a game of cat and mouse between him and the servants of Rictus.

###Tiny problems in the Holy Land

Rictus on one of his jaunts through the Hunting Grounds, he had once more taken mortal appearance in an avatar, heard the rumors of a strange new threat. Public order was deteriorating as the Waidmänner and Iron Judges had to deal with more and more incursions by blood drinking new monstrosities, who just didn't want to die easily.

As more and more defenders of the Hunting Grounds either hired out as mercenaries or went south to combat the vampiric plague put upon the world by Azrakal, Rictus himself went to investigate.

It was little shocking that the god of blood would have made such creatures. When he walked past a house one night he heard a scream. A vampire had gotten into a house and was in the process of preparing a “meal”. Rictus decided to teach the vampire a lesson.

He picked up his Codex of the Iron Law. Entered the house and literally bashed the vampire to death  and mush with the Codex of Law. In a retelling of the story the news on that the texts of the Iron Law could make vampires stand back and on contact even burned their skin like acid.

The people of the hunting grounds got primitive Codices made by making paper from wood pulp and writing down the Iron Law on big scrolls. As people learned to protect themselves somewhat, there was less need to hunt them in force and many among the Waidmänner and Iron Judges were free to return back north and try to reestablish public order.
