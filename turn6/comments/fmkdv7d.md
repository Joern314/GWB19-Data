# A Purely Mortal Struggle - Laeghaill, Knight-Errant Divine

That ashen blonde boy always spoke with kindness and honor, like he was born with a pious tongue. Others said he was exemplary of the Angel, that he was the kindest and most loving child to grace the city. So much so that he sought to enter into the Holy Order of the Starlit Saint

Laeghaill had been a faithful Cleric-Knight for the Beloved Angel for years. He never expected everything to be taken away from him in an instant.

Beggars they were called, and all he and Reyla knew to do was to extend grace towards them. And now she lied there, blood staining her sky-blue dress like crimson clouds.

*Why would they do this if they knew they would receive help?* Laeghaill's gripped his amulet tightly. He could feel the four wings outstretched from the flaming star. It thrummed with his fury.

*Dearest beloved Angel, if you hear me, forgive me of these curses that I breed. I know you can redeem the deepest sins, so show me your grace. But blood must be paid with blood.*

# Crisis: Tiny Problems in the Holy Land

Thyval was thriving, except for the raids from the barbaric Raiders. And there were numerous bands of exiles who swept out of the Wastes to prod the city. An assault from both sides could not be left unanswered, lest the blessing that was Thyval would fall.

The Rebukers prayed to the Angel to send grace upon them. Be it deliverance from the evils, or the redemption of their plagued hearts, they needed something. *Anything.*

Some grew desperate. Under the cover of night, a small band of acolytes, including the Lord Exalter, had ventured into the Wastes of Pain, begging the exiles to stop their incessant hits against Thyval. In defeat from failed negotiations, they trudged back home, now with a stench of poison on them.

According to the ancient law, they were required to be exiled permanently, but none had known of their endeavors. None except the Angel herself.

Oryllia had to end this. It would weaken both the city and her, this culmination of curse and blessing.

One of the Hallowed-Errant, home from a pilgrimage, had smelled the poison on them, and brought them before the Fair Elders. The guilty acolytes, including the Lord Exalter, were cast out to the Wastes, as according to the ancient law, holy divided from profane once again.
