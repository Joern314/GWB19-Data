[tiny problems in the holy land ] 

Over the years the Zepho guild of raha’stal have grown larger and more  greedy over the generations sense the founding of the city 

Some had even grown to no longer respect the pilgrimage of the mountains and insted cared more for charging the inhabitants of the pilgrimage villages for there protection and services 

These communities relied on raha’stal or they would be wiped out 

So the guild master and task masters, went to work...and began punishing those with greed in there hearts.  first revoking the privilege to enter the hall of heroes... upon further infractions they would be exiled for raha’stal into the mountains to join the very communities they had forsaken... if their where  still those who held large amount of greed in their heat after exile  and took advantage of their new communities, the task masters would sentence them to leave the prismatic plains and  mountains forever. Basically sentencing the under prepared  to death 

Beside this practice of exile , the guild master increased the education and training of the next generation of  adventurers, this re-education would cause the task master to send them   into the mountain communities .  increasing the food supplies, along with the amount of pilgrims of would be adventurers upon the holy land... many of who had seen friends and family exiled and so had the greed in there hearts doused and so for the most part the holy land was restored over the course of fifteen years
