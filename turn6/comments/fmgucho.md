**A Purely Mortal Struggle: Dealego the Bloody** 

Part I: Dealego of the Milerlo Misrei

Dealego had a fairly typical Nkarlen childhood. He was a middle child - number six of eleven - and had four brothers and six sisters. Only one thing set apart Dealego from the others, he was born into the lowest level of the Milerlo Misrei. Trained in typical goblin pursuits, he built up a skill set of shaping stone and making hats from the scaly skins obtained from the harsh jungles to the south of the city of Kzivo'gbamo.

When he reached maturity at age nine, he obtained a position as an Issakz (the lowest rank of "employee" equivalent to an intern) of Milerlo Cistern #2 in Kzivo'gbamo. His task boiled down to more or less extorting the local populace of their valuables for water and acting as muscle to bring gemcutters and masons under the Milerlo's control.

Things changed for Dealego when his younger brother killed a Kziba, or captain, of a rival Misrei for sleeping with his betrothed. To avoid what might amount to a running battle in the city the oath of vengeance was declared and the Milerlo Misrei received a note written in blood declaring his brother's life forfeit. Dealego did not take this news very well, he had been fond of his younger brother when the two had been growing up together. 

His brother sought refuge by fleeing to Nkloig Sekzil, supposedly outside the influence of the Misrei of Kzivo'gbamo. There he joined the Ranos and hid among the priesthood. Of course, the blame then instead fell on the rest of the family. Dealego found himself dragged down to the grand hall of the temple-caves of Nkan'gbamo to speak before Jikzek VII and the great feathered one. Interested in keeping the peace this pompous leader of the Ranos decided that either Dealego had to find his own brother and kill him or he would die in his stead. The poor goblin had little choice but agree to seek his brother in Nkloig Sekzil. He swore before the statues and murals of gods there and to the stone throne of Gon that he would carry out this vengeance and bring proper balance to the situation.

On his trip out of the caves, he was told by a stranger that his other brothers and sisters had vanished. When he frantically asked how this was possible, the stranger simply handed him some bloody rags and a note: blood for blood. His family had been murdered. They had been a liability; they had helped his brother escape.

So Dealego swore a second oath of vengeance that day; he would destroy the Milerlo Misrei as they had destroyed his family. No matter the cost. They would share his pain.
