**Dreams of Divinity: Voices from a Distant World**

*“Sssegbi rrrogliaalod aalau, Rrrla. I-k-k-kzekzzzobeg eg.”*

*The dark thing shifted in the cell behind the wall of divine runes, its reptilian eye glimmered like gold in the dark.*

*“I know, brother...” Gon found himself replying.*

*“You ssspeak-k-k like they do now... you look-k-k like them. All forrr... what?” The creature mocked as it shifted in the shadows of its cell trying to find a comfortable position. “Aalau sssegell rrrilo gegbo sek-k-kzilsss. Become Vengeanssse, Rrrla, do not deny your fate any longerrr. Gegbo reli-*

*“Enough of this.” A small voice broke in as a blurry looking little gryn with gold and gray feathers put his hand into Gon’s left hand and tugged, forcing Gon to look at him. The image seemed to wiggle and distort the dream around it.*

*“Sister is looking for you.”*

Gon jolted awake and for a moment the sensation of the little gryn’s hand lingered on his own. The runes had progressed faster than he wished over the course of the last two centuries. How long had he slept? Around the runes, his skin was turning into what appeared to be stone scales, the scars beginning to look like veins of quartz. The odd runes had started to appear on his left leg as well.

“Sister... *Igki*? ...Brother? I had a brother? ...Two brothers?” Gon murmured to himself as he tried to puzzle out the dream. It was if another world was calling to him, trying to draw him away. If his suspicions were correct, then these were fragments of his memories from before everything that he knew now. The idea was both terrifying and exciting; what had he been capable of in the past? Was he a divine being? Was he a semi-divine being? A mortal? What sort of magics were there in the past? Why had Nek and Hylatka kept him at a distance? But most importantly to Gon, why did he have the sphere of vengeance?

As the questions spiraled in Gon’s head, he looked to where The Retaliator sat in the center of a ritual circle. Study of the blade had revealed little so far; it was still powerless and linked to him.

“What are you, my friend?”

The black blade seemed to shift oddly in response and for a split second a golden reptilian eye glared out of it. Then it was gone. Gon jumped up in surprise but rubbed his eyes. He must have still been sleepy. Wrapping his arm in white and returning The Retaliator the scabbard on his side after a brief secondary glance, he set out to find Kain. He was the first to notice the disparity between the vengeance sphere and Gon himself. There was something he had to ask.
