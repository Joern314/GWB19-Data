 

Crisis in the Holy Land

On the holy island in the Bakwagalis river, the Scorpion Council was losing its sense of purpose during the Shatic dynasty of Wooxti-Kwashotl. The Black Wing Queen had tried to remain neutral in making appointments, never overlooking qualified Stings for the roles of governors, viziers, or generals, however the mere fact of the Prophet-Queen coming from the Society of the Black Wing was causing many humans and yashool to forsake family traditions and show fidelity to the raven. 

The Scorpion Council resisted this, they argued that it was impossible to show fidelity to the raven in Wooxti-Kwashotl because there were no ravens native to the jungle. In the year 205, Shata II was succeeded by Tavu, a human male Black Wing, her designated successor. Tavu saw the need to answer the challenges posed by the Scorpion council. He traveled to the Great Forest and negotiated with the chief of the ravens, returning with a flock of 1,000 to settle on the island of the Scorpion Council itself, (being human, Tavu was no stranger acting brashly). 

The Council responded with violence, trapping and killing all the ravens they could find. The ravens retaliated, catching and eating all the scorpions they could. It was all devolving rather quickly when Yashqal intervened. 

Yashqal created an apparition that could be seen across the island, of a raven and a scorpion wrestling in the air, the raven bit through the exoskeleton as the scorpion dealt a venomous blow to the bird. The message was clear to the priests, by fighting they would extinguish one another. In that year Tavu ordered the Scorpion Council expanded to include 10 Black Wings (5 human, 5 yashool as custom) and renamed the Guidance Council. Peace was restored to the island, and dance continued to be taught there.

Purely Mortal Struggle

The trade route between Raha’stal and Wooxti-Kwashotl ran overland through the jungle and over the mountain range of Primus. This spawned a hospitality industry catering to merchants making the months-long journey on horseback. The Crater of Thool was one such popular stop, so was Chalitsh to the West, a Kwashotl yashool settlement at the confluence of the Bakwagalis and its tributary. They received a Black Wing governor from Shata in the year 5, and their appointments continued to come from the capital. 

Ixto (b.191), a female yashool, was born into a noble family in Chalitsh. She prayed to Yashqal and Thool, as was custom. At 14 she was inducted into the Society of the Whisker. Ixto learned to show Fidelity to the titan bearcat in the way that her ancestors had - by stalking the beasts in the jungle with a group of her peers. At night they camped and translated their observations into dances. It was around this time that Tavu ascended to the throne in Wooxti-Kwashotl and brought ravens to the Holy Island of Dance. This distressed her and her elders greatly, to see a king play such favoritism among the dances. Ixto dreamt of one day representing her own Society of the Whisker on the Holy Island. She resolved to prove the worthiness of her society to be included on the Guidance Council, and to that end began to train to be part of the Calitsh governor’s personal guard.
