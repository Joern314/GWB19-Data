"Greetings to you, Gon Gryn! God of Earth and Vengeance! Mistress Lyva is right! The Rift holds knowledge of many world's magic and even some secrets of the void. As does its master. I am however not he, whom calls himself the Sorcerer. The master has taken an avatar and is walking the mortal world. I am his humble servant Panoptes. I am here to observe the world and record the death of mortals so Rift Keepers can be dispatched to gather their souls and bring them here for evaluation." The minor god said. His many, many eyes twitching and blinking into all directions.
