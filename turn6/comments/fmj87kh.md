"I'm not sure if I do like sharing..." Gon said and kissed her before smiling and letting her clean his sword. "I am, however, fine with letting others appreciate the gifts of the earth. Hrrm... to you I guess it would make more sense to say that all of the gems and metal would be worthless if they slept below the ground forever. It is good to show off those treasures."

The sword blade was black, but the sharp edges and pattern welded flames were a bright white, but the blade had a different feel to it than one might expect. It had a presence of its own, as if it were somehow a part of Gon himself. The guard and pommel still appeared as bird wings and a head with jeweled eyes. It seemed like it hadn't been used in a while. If Lyva looked away from it for a moment, she might just catch a glimpse of a golden reptilian eye out of the corner of her own.

"Lost... your tail?" Gon said as he pet her new tail curiously. "Well, I am glad it grew back...I don't know Prismari all that well, but I am sorry he didn't take it well... At least you had fun though, yes?"

Gon was silent for a moment, before continuing. "Vengeance is... almost... feral, if it gets out of hand. A curious mixture of hatred and... sometimes balance. I will admit that I at least understand heroism in the desire to change the world if the world has harmed you in some way... but heroism without a cause like that is beyond me."

"I kind of like that you are hot-blooded. We had a fight when we first met, remember?" Gon laughed. "Are you concerned about it?"
