"Does it matter if it is true if the mortals believe it, I wonder?"

"I will check with the Sorcerer, then... if he has such an extensive collection. The man seems rather secretive... not even bothering to tell my mortals about his little afterlife, and having yours and his not tell others either. I suppose death gods are always a problem..." Gon mused as he glanced off towards the horizon before looking back at Lyva with a sad frown.

"You know I can't promise to return if I don't even know what I am dealing with... I thought you would have put that together... It may be that if I leave, I might never return." He explained sadly. 

"That is simply how it is... but... Lyva, there are plenty here that love you and you have allies here... Surely losing me isn't that big of a loss? Look at all the wonderful work you've managed to do... even made up - a bit - with Azrakal!" Gon replied trying to reason with her holding his hands out in front of him.

"Now if you don't mind returning my sword, I'll just be off to see this Sorcerer friend of yours, alright?." Gon said holding out his right hand.
