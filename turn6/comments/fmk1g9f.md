"Good. Glad you're fine with me leaving... if necessary." Gon replied with a sigh of relief. He didn't notice her trying to slip The Retaliator into her hatch. 

"I haven't given up on other possibilities just yet... like I said, I don't really even know what this is." He said, tapping the stone on his arm.

Gon proceeded to tell Lyva about how he seemed to remember some kind of attack from the sky, being captured by some other gryn who seemed to be the original owner of The Retaliator. Another dream about a group of individuals lamenting some kind of spell that used a rune similar to the ones on his arm. One about being badly injured and one about talking to a creature that was apparently his brother and another little brother.

"...and he said 'sister is looking for you'. ...That's about it." Gon finished with a shrug, fully expecting nothing to come out of telling Lyva what he remembered so far.
