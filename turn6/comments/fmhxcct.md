Urak was a new person.  
He looked human, his soul was there yet he was different.

He was yelling at his riders, to make ready for more battles, more raids. And after that, he bites in to the neck of an unfortunate prisoner, draining her of blood.  
He drank deep and drained her in a matter of moments.
