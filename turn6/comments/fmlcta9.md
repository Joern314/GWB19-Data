[Yeah, I am totally fine with it. There will still be goblins roaming in the jungles. Their capital is like right next to the jungles and like you said there are a ton of them. There will be some random spurts of violent encounters with random goblin groups. They are just not occupying the jungle anymore, as I promised. I didn't say they attacked the city or settlement or anything. Or even that they were organized in any way.]
