Crisis: Tiny Problems in the Holy Land

Among the Vazari, a movement known as The Tunnelers became popularized. The Tunnelers believed that the tunnels that ran under the Tadaloan Island chain were in-fact the true home of the Vazari and that Malaphet was a false-divine whom had stolen their ancestors from the earth, keeping them under his watchful gaze to control them and starve their original creators. They claimed that the only way to destroy Malaphet was for all beings of sentient, free will to retreat underground, denying the false divine his stolen faith.

Of course the followers of Malaphet recognized such claims as heresy and struck out to remove the taint of the Tunnelers from the sacred islands once and for all. In a lightning raid the true people quickly captured the tunnelers and set to work afflicting them with Mindburn spell as to retain their usefulness while buring away those that had lead them to question the world  and word of their god.
