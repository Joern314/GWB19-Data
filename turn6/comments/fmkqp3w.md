# Crisis: Tiny Problems in the Holy Land

The mortals of Sunda-Tor had, perhaps, bitten off more than they could chew. It wasn't their fault mind, they just hadn't considered all the problems with running the land.

It was, really, just the one thing they had not considered: tourists. Not that the word would be used for at least another few centuries, but that was what they were.

People were interested in the wild things of the world, and the chance to see them up close, with trained professionals on hand to watch after them, became something of a favourable pastime in the surrounding region.

The problem, to put it in simple terms, was that the visitors weren't respectful of the nature they wanted to look at, gladly cutting their way through the underbrush if it meant getting to their destination faster.

Enter: Emrys. Emrys was a young human man, one who's family had watched after Sunda-Tor for generations. One day, after discovering another bush nearly destroyed by the visitors, he decided to do something about it.

He created scheduled tours of the land, ones that followed set paths. No longer could someone simply wander into Sunda-Tor and do as they pleased, instead the caretakers would guide the visitors themselves.

\[Also claiming this as part one of that mortal prompt, as I intend to do more with Emrys.\]
