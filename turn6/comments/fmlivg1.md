Lyva groggily cracked open an eye to look at her, then groaned, "Trying to sleep. My bed's too cold and soft so I came to sleep in my forge. Why are you..."    

She blinked, seemed to process her words, then cracked her tail, sending embers flying around as she stood up.    

"It's not my forge. My mistake. I didn't make this stuff. Moon's neutral." Lyva reminded herself, stretching, and looked over her. "I *am* angry at you. But we are square, so I'm not causing trouble. I'll leave."     

That said, she took a few dragging steps through the fire, almost as little movement as possible to enjoy the heat for longer.
