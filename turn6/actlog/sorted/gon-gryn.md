[Crisis: Tiny problem in the holy land prompt](

>**Crisis: Tiny Problems in the Holy Land**
>
>Nkloig Sekzil had grown to be quite a large city, but unlike Kzivo'gbamo it was not located in the seemingly endless and twisting caverns of the shattered mountains. This invariably led to a housing problem. The Nkarlen of Nkloig Sekzil had a large population of Gon's priests, the Ranos, who were exempt from menial duties. Added to the rapid increase in goblin population, this meant that caves could not be dug fast enough to accommodate the new generations. Many goblins were thus forced to build houses on the surface and spend more time above ground, thus slowly turning greener and weakening the power of the holy land.
>
>The Ranos, so connected to the history of the land soon became increasingly upset with these "greenskins" and sought the help of the most powerful local Misrei to help. The Nkelinego Misrei happily used this request to expand their power, and they created and enforced a mandate of round-the-clock digging for new homes. This was a fine temporary solution, but the criminal nature of the goblins meant that many other Misrei got involved in the same trade and that the caves were, perhaps, not up to snuff in terms of safety.
>
>Those who refused these drastic measures or who spoke up about the unsafe conditions of the new caves often disappeared, never to be heard from again. Some whole families who refused, including a few of the Ranos, were exiled to the green grasslands of Gbigolind. It is from this time period that Nkeloon or "greenskin", became something of an insulting term to the religious sect of the goblins who believed that it showed that one had spent too long away from the cool embrace of the earth.

[\+3 Mortal Struggle prompt](

>**A Purely Mortal Struggle: Dealego the Bloody** 
>
>Part I: Dealego of the Milerlo Misrei
>
>Dealego had a fairly typical Nkarlen childhood. He was a middle child - number six of eleven - and had four brothers and six sisters. Only one thing set apart Dealego from the others, he was born into the lowest level of the Milerlo Misrei. Trained in typical goblin pursuits, he built up a skill set of shaping stone and making hats from the scaly skins obtained from the harsh jungles to the south of the city of Kzivo'gbamo.
>
>When he reached maturity at age nine, he obtained a position as an Issakz (the lowest rank of "employee" equivalent to an intern) of Milerlo Cistern #2 in Kzivo'gbamo. His task boiled down to more or less extorting the local populace of their valuables for water and acting as muscle to bring gemcutters and masons under the Milerlo's control.
>
>Things changed for Dealego when his younger brother killed a Kziba, or captain, of a rival Misrei for sleeping with his betrothed. To avoid what might amount to a running battle in the city the oath of vengeance was declared and the Milerlo Misrei received a note written in blood declaring his brother's life forfeit. Dealego did not take this news very well, he had been fond of his younger brother when the two had been growing up together. 
>
>His brother sought refuge by fleeing to Nkloig Sekzil, supposedly outside the influence of the Misrei of Kzivo'gbamo. There he joined the Ranos and hid among the priesthood. Of course, the blame then instead fell on the rest of the family. Dealego found himself dragged down to the grand hall of the temple-caves of Nkan'gbamo to speak before Jikzek VII and the great feathered one. Interested in keeping the peace this pompous leader of the Ranos decided that either Dealego had to find his own brother and kill him or he would die in his stead. The poor goblin had little choice but agree to seek his brother in Nkloig Sekzil. He swore before the statues and murals of gods there and to the stone throne of Gon that he would carry out this vengeance and bring proper balance to the situation.
>
>On his trip out of the caves, he was told by a stranger that his other brothers and sisters had vanished. When he frantically asked how this was possible, the stranger simply handed him some bloody rags and a note: blood for blood. His family had been murdered. They had been a liability; they had helped his brother escape.
>
>So Dealego swore a second oath of vengeance that day; he would destroy the Milerlo Misrei as they had destroyed his family. No matter the cost. They would share his pain.

[\-5 for Oxeblas gems and placing them in the grasslands](

>The products of The Sorcerer's alterations to reality were interesting to Gon. This death god had separated the soul and the force that keeps bodies alive into two separate things. Whats more, he had this power was explosive. It naturally converted to heat and light when released into the environment. Gon saw plenty of possibilities for this new arrangement. If the animating force could be harnessed in some way and concentrated. It could perhaps be extracted and used to power golems or other creatures that had been turned into statues by his handy little petrification magic. That would need more consideration.
>
>Research was one thing, but field trials would be necessary, luckily there were plenty of goblins to spare. So Gon breathed into the earth around the grasslands of the second continent a new substance, Oxeblas. These bright red and opaque gems gathered the essence of animation from when unliving were put down in the near vicinity of them. This essence was slowly concentrated as more and more unliving were eliminated in close proximity. As they took in more and more essence they would slowly turn black and become more and more brittle.
>
>When one of these crystals was broken that animating force would be released all at once and convert into magic energy like normal. The size of these crystals determines their capacity to contain this animating force; a totally black crystal cannot hold any more.
>
>\[-3 for Oxeblas, a dangerous magic / animating force storing gem. It is unstable, explosive, and concentrates this force. -2 to make naturally occurring deposits in the grasslands (Gbigolind) of the second continent.\]

[\-1 contact clergy, -3 for gem weaving magic, -2 to keep it secret](

>The first explosion was absolutely pathetic; the goblin "scientist" who discovered the first oxeblas gem found only a small naturally occurring version in a wash out near one of the river beds that flowed into the inland sea. This crystal was tiny, but the Nkarlen - who's name was Nkirli - pocketed the crystal and went about her day hunting down small game and killing them twice. In goblin understanding everything had two lives, including mortals. When she returned that night with three small hares, she found that the crystal had turned completely black, something that did not amuse her. It had been such a pretty red. The she dropped the brittle little crystal and with a loud pop and small flash it burst into thousands of pieces. It gave Nkirli a small fright.
>
>The next day, she returned to the place that she had found the tiny one and collected a whole bunch to take to the local Misrei. The Misrei, having no idea what the thing was, went to consult the priests of the Ranos. The Ranos also had little idea of what it was and so they in turn prayed for an answer from the feathered one who knew all of the things that dwelled in his realm. Sometimes this was a pointless exercise, as Gon ignored the majority of their requests for information; he was not interested in naming every grub they had managed to dig up. This time was different, however, and Gon chose to appear before his priests to explain their use and gift them with a new magic, at the behest of Nkom, who could be persistent at times.
>
>So he taught them how to manipulate gems as though they were fabrics; how to soften and weave them together and how to join them together to form larger crystals. While not quite to the level of Nkom's miraculous gem creations, it was a start.
>
>\[-3 for gem weaving magic, -2 to keep it secret, -1 contact clergy - allows one to change gems into a fabric/thread like form and join them together to make, well, anything you could make with normal fabric. This magic also allows you to harden these things back into gems. The most skilled practitioners can make an almost silk-like substance out of gems. The main problem is that while manipulating these gems one must maintain a constant flow of magic energy while performing this act. As such, larger projects require a lot of magic. Estimated rate is 3 human equivalent mortals for something like a dress.\]

[\-2 for a basement on the moon](

>Gon, having noticed a great amount of commotion on the moon decided he should go have a look. He wasn't one for looking up at the skies normally since he had made a home for himself in the temple caves of Nkan'gbamo as that would require looking through the mountains above. Gon found the tower curious and noticed everyone setting up rooms in the tower, even what appeared to be a nice pool of blood. Not one to live above ground, he noticed that the tower lacked a basement so he made one.
>
>Into the stone and dirt below the surface he carved many round and luscious chambers with circular columns of the finest marble and high vaulted ceilings, this time crafted to match the various constellations in the night sky, and brought along Nkom to naturally form the finest gemstone furniture; somehow soft like fabric but with all the beauty of rubies, sapphires, emeralds, diamond, etc. 
>
>He also built into the walls naturally formed mosaics of all of the gods against a scene of their respective holy lands accented with numerous gemstones. At the center he created the largest chamber with a naturally formed long table of quartz to host all of the gods should there ever be a proper feast.
>
