>#Adrift in the Seas of Time
>
>Dawri was lost within the winding paths of the Timestream, lost to the Universe at its very start. But for a God of Time and Fate, such an absence was not entirely irreparable. Throughout the millennia, Dawri subtly reached into the Prime, affecting the world in invisible ways, slowly making alterations, setting the groundwork for something...
>
>Dawri's first overt action was to reach through the Timestream, and touch the mind of a tribal chieftain named Namur of the Hunting Grounds, whose tribe was suffering from famine, pestilence, and disaster. Namur was struck with a great revelation, that in a month's time, a great upheaval would occur, and a new land with beauty and life would spring from the ocean, and Namur's people would have a new place to settle, and in return, they need only spread the name Dawri...
>
>Namur mobilized his people, taking everything they could, and traveling northeast, to a peninsula that Namur had seen in his vision. After weeks of travel, suffering and starving, several dying before the tribe could reach the cost. There, a week later, the earth began to shake. At first, the tribe was struck with fear, but not Namur. Namur stood at the cost, staring at the horizon, arms spread, welcoming his tribe's savior.
>
>Rising from the ocean was a massive landmass, seeming to grow out of the water's surface, time seeming to pass decades in mere seconds, life blooming from the fertile earth, now populated with the native life, and a few new forms of life, such as great stags that moved with unnatural speed, and black trees with glowing roots that seemed to bloom in places that would one day be important.
>
>The sky seemed to crack, and shatter open, and exploding from the sky was a massive blue comet, streaking towards the world. The people of the tribe were momentarily shaken, but suddenly, the comet was petrified, and in the sky like a moon hovering over Namur's holy land, the blue comet hovered, a marker in the sky proving the sovereignty of their holy land...
>
>As the decades continued, Namur passed on, but his memory continued. A city was erected in his name, the land itself named Verdantus, as a civilization sprung from the land as life had.
>
>Sometime in, a miraculous event occurred: in the sky, seventy-eight lights shined brightly in the sky, twenty-two of them brighter than the rest, and with a flash, they shot into the horizon, vanishing from view. At the same time, a warrior named Delia, fighting off a band of raiders, was suddenly infused with immense strength and invulnerably, with which she fought back a number of bandits, hoping to pilfer the various goods produced by the farmers and tradesmen working the lands.
>
>Likewise, many others rose in power, suddenly struck with inexplicable power at their most desperate, these people becoming known as the Archons of Fate. These individuals would gain extraordinary powers associated with their strife, be it battle, diplomacy, grief, or the suffering of loved ones.
>
>And with the arrival of the Archons came sudden stability to Verdantus. The people were no longer struggling every day, and were no longer fighting for survival. They could build, create laws and infrastructure, build culture and trade, and as time passed, they did. Namur became a thriving city, a veritable metropolis of its time, and Verdantus became a thriving, prosperous kingdom.
>
>In their prosperity, the Verdanti did not pay the outside world much mind. They had their trade relations with neighboring nations, of course, but distant lands did not hold much public interest. There was debate, of course. Many simply assumed that the land that lied beyond were barren and simple, with nothing worth claiming, while some believed the world simply... ended, with a bottomless cliff, or empty blackness. There were some explorers, but most did not return from their voyages, and although some returned, most did not return with much that changed any minds.
>
>As for what Verdantus had to share with its neighbors? Well, in keeping with its name, with its fertile land and plentiful fields, Verdantus prided itself on its production of crops and livestock, able to produce large stores of grain that were once, and to a lesser degree still are, the target of many a bandit and raider. Anything that would survive long voyages to neighboring nations was fair trade.
>
>Of course, not everything was peaceful and perfect in Verdantus. The grain itself was a matter of great controversy. Not over the existence of grain, but who owns it, and how to barter it. Several prominent lords have, over the passage of time, purchased large swathes of fertile land, and demanded taxation from any farmers wishing to make use of that land, or hiring the farmers on themselves. Such private ownership was making it difficult for independent farmers to make a living.
>
>As such, several prominent farmers began appealing to the current King of Namur, King Auron, who, not wanting to upset the lords in his court, sent the farmers on their way. And for now, the farmers were silent, toiling in silent contempt, as the work continued.
>
>But one farmer was not silent. A woman named Yalim, a farmer who's property was forcefully purchased and claimed by a lord, having her evicted, spoke loudly against the King, and claimed to spread word of these misdeeds...
>
>Not long after, she was attacked, seemingly by bandits, and killed, the voices silent once again...
>
>Being a meager peasant woman, her passing, while tragic, made no major societal ripples, despite the implication. Her daughter, Vanir, was not convinced...
>
>But Vanir knew the price of ousting this corruption publicly... and how little that alone would make a difference, in the end. She needed to be subtle, and moreover, much more... tangible in her actions.
>
>Vanir began a plan... one that would bring great upheaval, to the city of Namur, and the whole of Verdantus...
>
>Dawri, meanwhile, was silently watching. He did not want to tip the scales himself, but... he knew which side he was rooting for...
