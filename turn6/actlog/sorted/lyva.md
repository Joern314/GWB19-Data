[Crisis: Tiny Problems in the Kiln Islands](

>##Lyvkerel Grows    
>
>As time passed, the city of Lyvkerel grew to dominate the southern coast of the great Kiln Island, as a mass of huts and buildings often designed with competitive complexity by rival artisans. Most who lived in the city by this point were born there, with less immigration to the great confusion, and only dedicated metal workers coming to seek tuition and learning.    
>
>Some of these were humans from the mainland who desired to learn to work the Kiln Forge and produce enchanted items, only to be denied by the Apokyph Masters of the forge for they had no life marking, no caste and little skill with magic. In their fury at being denied such, even with their skills, and the complacency of the city, the humans decided it was time that Lyvkerel itself should be reforged. Fuses were hidden, oil was spilled, and one night, much of Lyvkerel was immersed in swathes of flame.     
>
>Being built of wood and mushroom common to the isles, the city was devastated, forges destroyed, stocks laid bare, and many Apokryphs died. It did not take long for fingers of blame to be pointed, and in the aftermath, the Iron Judges found the arsonists, seeking to claim that Lyva had burnt the city for their idleness. Their lies failed them, and in wrath, it was decided that the arsonists ought to be sacrificed to the ForgeMother for their crimes, thrown into the burning fires of her volcanic forge.    
>
>Yet upon doing so, the mountain began to rumble, the island shook, and Lyva decided to repay their gift with a present of her own. Once more, comets of strange metals flew from the Kiln Islands, and formed within its earth for miners to seek. Some were new, enchanted substances, while others were discovered to be combinations of other metals, alloys with unique properties.

>With the gifts and the devastation of the city, Lyvkerel was actually reforged and reinvigorated, rebuilt again of lasting stone with hotter fires and metal decorations, never to be burned away again.

[-4 Acts for Strong Vampire Weakness: Property Permissions](

>Lyva was fascinated, she could sense the endless hunger contained here, the seeds sown, though the methods employed were not to her liking. She watched him for a few days, watching the raids and brutality, it was all so messy and savage. And so she laid a curse on their kind, that they would need owners permission to enter homes and towns, that he could not simply ride in but his foes could prepare and meet him head on. A Vampire which enters property without permission becomes far weaker, their strength a fraction of a normal mortals.

>That done, she decided to go and see the maker of the breed, searching for Azrakel as she felt this new hunger in her being.

>"You're stingy." She complained, but nonetheless vanished off to honour the bargain.

>---------------------------     
>Sabin was a human trader winding her way around the continent when she was visited. The spectacle of the gigantic black serpent filling the skies above made her recoil and almost call out to her crew, but they could not see it. See her.     
>The Burning Serpent trickled down from the sky that she was going about this all wrong. Too many crew members for this size of ship and the cargo, she would never make her fortune like this, she would lose everything to freeloaders if she kept going, never see her investments paid back.     
>Yet she could be helped, the Serpent said. Blood and Gold could flow together, if she offered the freeloaders, the ones dragging her down to the Skinless and the Skinner, then she could become greater than she ever dreamed.     
>With the hissing whispers in her ear, Sabin found herself doing so, casting down the most mutinous of her sailors once and then again when he tried to rise, the blood soaking into the wood. The others worked hard to avoid her wrath, each day the laziest could expect to be flogged, the bloody whip offered to the gods, and their ship grew faster and fuller.    
>When the ship made port in Bakraftel, the Serpent directed her to find other desperate folk, those seeking more and more, and show them what paying the blood price could bring.        
>Within a few weeks of stealthy work, smuggling criminals and teaching fanatics, Sabin conducted a great sacrifice and was reborn, hungrier than ever before with serpent-like fangs and golden eyes, gifted with an immortal life to pursue riches and feed the hungers of her gods.

[+3 Acts: A purely Mortal Struggle I: Idren](

>**The Struggle of Idren I**
>
>On the edges of the Great Kiln Island, Idren was born to a clan of farmers known as the Estkin, Apokyphs who farmed the larger fungi of the islands using waste and dung. Seeking to escape such a life, his father handed the property over to this brother in order to move into the great city of Lyvkerel seeking greater opportunities. Smiths and mages were well regarded, and Idren's life markings were unlike those of his parents, so the family hoped that in time he might be appointed as a mage or philosopher. In the meantime, they worked hard as servants to a great smith, maintaining and pumping his forge and dwelling in a hovel alongside it.
>
>Tragedy struck when the great fire of Lyvkerel was begun by arsonists, and much of the city caught blaze. Idren found himself lost within a hellscape quickly, as those who suffocated amidst smoke rose once more as ravenous unliving, and then exploded and spread more fire across the city when they fell. His mother fell to a falling beam, becoming a scrounging ravenous monster trapped in place. His father fell driving a chisel into the head of another unliving, engulfed and sent to rest by the ensuing blast.
>
>When the smoke cleared, Idren found himself somehow alive, having managed to scamper through the wreckage and rubble to safety. He was scarred, life-markings burnt in places as to be unreadable, and his mind far more so.
>
>How could the great parents allow such tragedy to befall them? Why did the Sorcerer, Father of his kind, wish for him to see family and neighbours turn to shambling feral monsters? Why would the Forgemother Lyva burn her children? In the coming weeks, priests spoke of reforging, of the trial making the city stronger and hotter, but the orphaned apokryph had nothing of his peoples gods.
>
>Instead he found his way to the docks and heard of the Goddess of water, a Goddess who took what she wanted and gave nothing back. Such seemed fair to the boy, and soon he fell amongst pickpockets, a small fishhook in his ear as a token of the Knave, and a reminder of what he ultimately desired- he would never become one of the shambling unliving. He would claim Immortality.
