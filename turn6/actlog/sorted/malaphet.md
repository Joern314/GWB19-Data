>Among the Vazari, a movement known as The Tunnelers became popularized. The Tunnelers believed that the tunnels that ran under the Tadaloan Island chain were in-fact the true home of the Vazari and that Malaphet was a false-divine whom had stolen their ancestors from the earth, keeping them under his watchful gaze to control them and starve their original creators. They claimed that the only way to destroy Malaphet was for all beings of sentient, free will to retreat underground, denying the false divine his stolen faith.
>
>Of course the followers of Malaphet recognized such claims as heresy and struck out to remove the taint of the Tunnelers from the sacred islands once and for all. In a lightning raid the true people quickly captured the tunnelers and set to work afflicting them with Mindburn spell as to retain their usefulness while buring away those that had lead them to question the world  and word of their god.

>\[Crisis prompt, religious cults popping up to Oppose Malaphet,  attempting to escape into the tunnels to avoid Malaphets view and deny him worship, solved by capturing the culprits and removing their heretical memories\]

Malaphet joins the Moon Pantheon [here](

>Malaphet watched the serpent ascend from the planet, as he watched most ongoings below on his left-overs below. The ascension itself was not uncommon, he noted this one flying all over the place doing various things. As such he began to relegate more of his attention elsewhere until he noticed her destination wasn't anywhere on the surface but instead on the moon, beyond where the gods interest normally strayed. Curious, Malaphet drew closer to watch, listen, and maybe interact.

[A mortal struggle p1 prompt](

>**A Purely Mortal Struggle p1**
>
>Halmeus was a young lad, second son of Aphirius, Shaman of the Clan Gravus. He had had a relatively normally childhood for a Vazari of his status, he had successfully dominated his first Unliving at age 7, a little late by average though he did grow to be more independent then normal due to his only caretaker being a elderly man of the tribe who had, before being subjected to the Mindburn spell, been a master boatmaker, meanwhile his elder brother spent much of his time helping their father run the village and subsequently had little time to spare for a young child.
>
> The elderly man liked to regale Halmeus of tales of the outside world, even though he had never left the Tadaloan Islands, and even if he had, the Mindburn spell would have removed any memory of this. Despite this, Halmeus was taken by the old mans description of the outside world, his imagination running wild as he listened to the old man speak.
>
>As he grew older Halmeus trained under the elderly man and was taught how to masterfully craft a boat, or at least that is what he would have liked to claim, but the old man was beginning to deteriorate fast mentally and became unable to complete Halmeus's training. When the time came Halmeus was the one who was given the honor of inducing The First Death upon the old man in recognition of their closeness, and after mentally dominating the Unliving that had taken his mentor's body he set out to create a ship of his own with which he could travel the world, completing the dream that the old man had sparked in his childhood.
>
>When he finished crafting the boat(which he would later go on to dub The Serpent's Glide), it would not have been by any means considered a beautiful ship by Vazari standards. Too deep did it's hull run, a danger in the shallow waters of the Island chain and a sign of poor craftsmenship. Despite this, Halmeus managed to convince several of his more wanderlust taken friends to follow him on his dream to see the outside world, and so, with a full hold of trade goods that he hoped to barter with the outside world and use to fund his expedition, he set out for farther shores and stranger sunsets.
