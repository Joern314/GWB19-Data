Mortal Prompt

>#Prompt: A Purely Mortal Struggle I
>
>His name was Raldric
>
>He had rode, raided, herded, eaten.  
>All his life in the blood plains.
>
>He had seen his fellow riders die to the Iron Judges and the hunters of the forests, how they could only raid at the outskirts of the forest, how the big city hide behind it's walls and coward, yet no horse could climb it.
>
>There must be a way to become stronger, most riders focus so much on mounted combat that when they step off their horses, they become much weaker.  
>Sure, on the open plain the riders are unbeatable, but few stay out there.
>
>So he left, he took his personal horses with him, some deer to feed him on the trip and left.
>
>He ventured far and wide to find other way to battle and gain strength, the Red God wanted blood, and blood he would get.  
>He knew he could not gain the strength of the forest people, no rider would ever accept them anyway and no forest dweller would accept him.
>
>He ventured far until he meet with the great blue, so big and far, far beyond what he could know.  
>He encountered a wooden house on the blue, a ship they called it, he said he wanted passage far away and thus, after paying with his deer meat and hide, he got passage for him and his horses.  
>He was not leaving them behind, he could not call himself a rider if he did.
>
>Raldric did not take the sea travel well, the great blue waved back and forth and he vomited many times.
>
>Eventually, they struck land and he departed.
>
>This land was strange, many mountains made it harder to ride but soon, he came by people.
>
>Naturally, he stole everything they had. Raldric figured it was the best way to get the strongest to come to him.  
>He did not kill any, he would need not to fight to the death, just to talk.
>
>---
>
>[/u/andrewjamesdrake encounter with your people]
>
>Soon. Warriors showed up they battled, struck back and forth but Raldric had his trusted horse. He was faster than the warriors could ever hope to be and Raldric was adapt at mounted battle.  
>
>But the warriors was strong, after Raldric killed five of them, he noticed he was injured. He let the last get away.  
>He tried to bandage his wounds up and get some rest.
>
>but a day later, some more warriors showed up, these one looked far harder than the first ones.  
>Raldric was injured, bleeding but he still rode out to meet them in battle.
>
>It was a tough battle. None of them died and then Raldric stopped.  
>The warriors was unsure.
>
>And Raldric spoke
>
>"Your blood must be strong, have you drunk deep from other warriors? Or strong beasts of the land?"  
>The Warriors just looked confused at each other...
>

>#Crisis: Tiny Problems in the Holy Land
>
>Azrakal was fond of blood, but he wanted it, and now the riders spill blood far less and less as his shrine?  
>Unacceptable.  
>There needs to set a precedence that all blood letting should be there. It should be a holy ritual, one of strength and *power*.
>
>Azrakal readied himself and called on Sarash, great pain was to be done.
>
>---
>
>One young man, Urak, a child of a chief started to hear things in his sleep, dreams spoke to him and called him to do some actions.  
>He would hunt Strike Wolves in the plains, drag them to the blood shrine and sacrifice them there. He would drink their blood and become more powerful.  
>He did this many times.
>
>Soon, by some mysteries reason, his own father was found dead near the shrine. Pale with blood loss, how strange.
>
>He lead his tribe to raid, they struck at the forest men and the city to the west. These attacks however was not killing and looting however, instead, they looted and took prisoner, somewhat unusual for the Riders.
>
>[/u/horatius-cocles and /u/dragoneyecreations, some upstart rider is stealing people  
>-2 acts: Contact mortal]
>
>These prisoners were taken to the blood shrine deep in the plains where the chief himself sacrificed them. The other riders were confused by this, these were simple people they captured, they were hardly strong and worthy to have their strength taken.
>
>But as the chief continued, the sky darken around the shrine. The wind took up. Soon, he tortured the prisoners before drawing their blood.
>
>Then, in a huge vat he collected a great amount of blood, he drank it all.
>
>Urak screamed as his body was twisted.  
>Fangs grew in his mouth, his nails became like claws and in an instant, his heart stop beating and then started.  
>He stood up once more, more powerful than ever before.
>
>The other riders stood in awe, he had spilled blood for the red god, more blood than anyone before him, and he was clearly rewarded.

>People chosen by Azrakal can be chosen to become vampires, only way to attract Azrakal's attention is by sacrificing and spilling huge amounts of blood.  
>All vampires belongs to a bloodline, each bloodline can have different blessings, the base blessing is as follow:
>
>Base Blessings:  
>**Power**: Even a newly turned Vampire is far stronger than a normal mortal  
>**Blood Healing**: A vampire, unless burned to ash, will regenerate eventually (bigger injury, more time needed, complete body reconstruction is about a decade).  
>**Blood sense**: Able to detect beings with blood all around themselves.  
>**Unlife**: A vampire is technically, a unliving, having died but their soul still remains in their body. This means they won't die of old age (but they are no longer mortals, so no worship can benefit from them).  
>**Blood kin**: Can pass on the Vampire blessing to another person, this rituals demands magical blood. The new kin lose 10% of the total vampire power. Only a vampire turned by Azrakal himself is at 100% power.  
>(first generation is 100%, second 90%, third 80% etc. etc.)
>
>[-22 acts: Base Vampire Bloodline  
>higher physical prowress" (3), "slowly regenerate injuries naturally" (3), "survive unless destroyed thoroughly" (5),  "sense blood" (2), "don't age" (6 because regeneration+survival are also there), "don't need food but grow mad if hungry" (3)]
>
>It comes with weakness however:  
>All vampires feels the thirst for mortal blood, animal blood does not work.  
>Blood healing also consumes blood when healing, making the vampire more thirsty as he heals. The Vampire however, being a mockery of life and death, won't starve to death, but will feel the thirst stronger and stronger to the point of madness.  
>A vampire waking up after a decade of healing his destroyed body will pretty much go in to a feral state to find blood to drink.
>
>The First Vampire Bloodline (Urak bloodline):  
>**Flight**: They possess wings they can use to fly with, wings can be hidden away.  
>**Blood Attunement**: Blood Magic works stronger for them  
>
>[-6 acts: Urak's Bloodline  
>(3 for flight, 3 for blood magic boost)]
>
>##Weakness
>
>Now, you might ask: What about weaknesses? Being burned to ash does not sound like a weakness, sounds like a strength to survive anything but that.  
>Well, yes.  
>
>I will allow other players to introduce weaknesses to the Vampires, your god might see this blight on existence and go "no, I rather not have mortals be dominated by these super-abominations".  
>
>**Small weakness**: Things that inconvenience the vampire. (ex: Vampire can't cross a line of salt)  (2 acts)  
>**Medium weakness**: Things that can injure a vampire or force it to go away, but won't kill it (ex: Holy Symbol + prayer with faith repel and cause pain to vampires) (3 acts)  
>**Strong weakness**: Injures a vampire greatly, can be deadly in large quantities (ex: Holy Water burns vampires, the burns will take a decades to heal up) (4 acts)  
>**Deadly Weakness**: Can permanently kill a vampire (fairly) easily (ex: wooden stake to the heart) (5 acts)
>
>Let's begin with 1 of each weakness and 2 small weakness? (PS: Prices are subjected to change as per GM decisions (sure, maybe I should have run it pass him first to get the OK signal for all things, but meh, that is for boring people, I also typed all this out on reddit before that idea crossed my mind.)
>
>Also!
>
>##Other Bloodlines
>
>Other players may create other bloodlines, they cost their basic blessing costs (see basic/Uraks bloodline above for example)  
>The base cost have been payed by me, you only need to pay the cost for the spesific blessing on the new bloodline.  
>Maybe we throw in a 2 acts cost if you want to turn someone behind my back (i.e, without a massive pile of blood sacrifices)
>
>---

>[oi, /u/joern314, you ok with this? Costs can be very easily changed with a single edit.]

>[/u/gwydion-drys, I think the civil war happened up there.]
>
>The Blood Cults were angry.  
>Cast out from their own homelands for using a power that the proud defenders themselves used.  
>Hypocrites.
>
>Raldric had told them of the tales of the red god, a god of strength and war, a god of domination. And the Black Lady, it was clear that their old mistress was the Black Lady.  
>They both demanded you train until you bones break, to train until the skin splintered open, to push though the pain.
>
>One man, a leader among the blood cults known as **Derak** had gained much support and he hoped to play this for his own gains.  
>He came out, said the red god had spoken to him and that now, he told them of a new land, a land they will call home so they can enact vengeance.
>
>The people cheered for their new leader, their king.
>
>Of course, the same night he was actually visited by the red god, a huge, flayed man, constantly dripping with blood.  
>The Red God was pleased with that he had done. He had spilled blood and now he was pulling the strings of an entire population.  
>But he only wanted blood, he directed Derak to move to a jungle, there, he would find a weak and pathetic people, he was to enslave them, sacrifice them.
>
>Derak was now somewhat afraid, little did he know the god he claimed to have spoken to him would visit him.
>
>But he did as he could.
>
>---
>
>The War with the goblins were not a great one, they were far stronger than any goblin could ever hope to be, they enslaved them, killed them in blood rituals to the red god.  
>They had the slaves construct a city for them, acting as labor. Centered around one of the rivers in the jungle.  
>They called this city **Redgash**
>
>They would go out, kill mighty and powerful beasts and drink their blood, enslave the beasts and train them, they would be useful in the war to come.
>
>And in a grand ritual, Derak had so many goblins sacrifised in one night that the blood poured down the temple on to the ground, and he was transformed.  
>People looked on his new blessed form and knew the red god was with them.
>
>Derak, now a vampire declared that they were now the **Vengeful**, and they would have vengeance.

>/u/whosgotyourskinnow, remember those goblins in the savage jungle?  
>They are slaves now.  
>Also, this new civilization is focused on pure vengeance, you might be interested.
