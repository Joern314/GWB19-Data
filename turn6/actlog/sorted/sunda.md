[\-2 to make bat-winged, cliff jumping tigers. -2 to tell people I did that](

>"Warriors, ha!" Sunda grunted, looking at the land that Mair had claimed. "I'll show them warriors."
>
>It resembled a tiger, as that had been the animal he'd begun with. Large bat-like wings, done in the same striped pattern, rested on its back. Not enough for true flight of course, but enough to glide from treetops and clifftops.
>
>The paws, both hind and fore, had to be redone. More dexterous, with claws designed to pierce stone, so that they could scale cliff and tree.
>
>Their tails were built anew, now tipped with a spear-tip like piece of bone, one that was covered in sharp ridges.
>
>"These should test them fine enough." he muttered, turning his new creations loose. That done he whispered in the minds of the locals, told them that the Wild Lord had seen their skill and prowess and had sent them a challenge worthy of their skill.

[Holy Land Prompt, also I'd like to claim this as my Mortal Prompt](

># Crisis: Tiny Problems in the Holy Land
>
>The mortals of Sunda-Tor had, perhaps, bitten off more than they could chew. It wasn't their fault mind, they just hadn't considered all the problems with running the land.
>
>It was, really, just the one thing they had not considered: tourists. Not that the word would be used for at least another few centuries, but that was what they were.
>
>People were interested in the wild things of the world, and the chance to see them up close, with trained professionals on hand to watch after them, became something of a favourable pastime in the surrounding region.
>
>The problem, to put it in simple terms, was that the visitors weren't respectful of the nature they wanted to look at, gladly cutting their way through the underbrush if it meant getting to their destination faster.
>
>Enter: Emrys. Emrys was a young human man, one who's family had watched after Sunda-Tor for generations. One day, after discovering another bush nearly destroyed by the visitors, he decided to do something about it.
>
>He created scheduled tours of the land, ones that followed set paths. No longer could someone simply wander into Sunda-Tor and do as they pleased, instead the caretakers would guide the visitors themselves.
>
>\[Also claiming this as part one of that mortal prompt, as I intend to do more with Emrys.\]
