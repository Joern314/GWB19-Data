>With the horns of war blaring and so many of his people's mages going west to fight or trade in the civil war the Sorcerer entered the Rift and went west himself. Surveying the war and what divine interference was going on there.

>The city of Epoidos was in real danger of losing its edge on the forefront of magic. Many of its best mages wandered to offer their services to highest bidder. Prime example was the civil war brewing on Secundus, the second continent. Amalah had been split right down the middle by the arrival of a blood rider from Primus. 
>
>The brewing conflict necessitated a wealth of weapons, armor and of course magic. The mages of Epoidos were the best in the world. They knew all the theurgic cantrips and the enhancing runes of the Sorcerer.
>
>The Sorcerer of course took notice of this. He clad himself in a mock mortal form, an avatar. He assumed the role of the Vir Sacra and claimed to be his own prophet. To solidify  Epoidos' cutting age talents in magic, he taught the Apokryph of the White Gates Necrurgy.
>
>With the power to transplant a bit of knowledge, skill and ability from one soul to another, it  cut the time the mages of Epoidos needed to train essentially in half.

>###A Purely Mortal Struggle

>Among the young people of Epoidos was one boy. His private name, only his family and friends were allowed to use was Yrdin. To all others he was Ambrosius. Ambrosius was a young Apokryph.
>
>The runic markings on his body had destined him for the Citizen caste. Which meant a life as a tradesman or farmer. 
>
>He underwent his ritual initiation and his innate magical talents were activated by the sacrifice to the Sorcerer. However Ambrosius wanted nothing more than to belong to the caste of Guardians, being a valiant defender of his home and family.
>
>So instead of accepting his lot in life and have his education taken over by the mages and the people of his supposed caste and traveled first south, to the lands of Rictus the god of hunting in hopes of learning the arts of combat from the WaidmÃ¤nner, to prove that he ought to be a Guardian
