## Gods

### Azrakal

**Appearance**: A flayed man with little cloths.  
Previously: A human male with black tattoos over almost his entire body. No hair and wears simple cloths that covers very little of him.  

**Spheres**: Blood and Power

**Plans and Style**: Desires blood, lot's of blood, so much blood. Will create short lived empires that goes out to capture people for blood sacrifices. Also create Vampires. Mostly being Evil.

**Origin**: Born from a divine drop of blood.

**Further explanation**:

### The Forgotten

**Player**: /u/Abacadaren

**Spheres**: Lost things and Sentiments

**Appearance**: The Forgotten appear as a pile of discarded scrap and items, like a junkyard given life. Broken dolls, Old tools, Books with torn pages, all set in motion of one united goal: to have back what once meant so much to them.

As far as sound, The Forgotten are in a way able to speak, either through old and worn voice boxes and speakers, or the imitation of speech through the crunching and creaking of it's piles.

**Plans and Style**: The Forgotten intend to be remembered and to reduce the number of things that are lost. Their ultimate goal is, in a way, their own destruction and the removal of their furthered creation

**Origin**: Since the beginning of creation, creations have been set to the ways side. Things that once meant so much to someone can come to mean nothing in time. It's hard to remember exactly when you forgot, just that you forgot it. When The Forgotten tried to not be is anyone's guess.

**Further explanation**:

Lost things here in refers to second death style things, lost to the point no one else would be able to find/connect. This includes lost memories as well, to tie into Sentiment. The dead are a difficult case, so to set it as clear and best as possible I deal in lost things, not lost people. Spirits and souls can remember things and pass on their memories, but they do not count as remembering things themselves.

Sentiment refers to connection and emotion, like love or care (though it can be negative sentiments). The feelings one has towards a favorite stuffed animal, or the love for a family member.

### Glypha

/u/Senelaria

**Spheres**: Fear and Flesh

**Appearance**: At first glance she looks like a beautiful young woman, but the less you pay attention to her, the more you can perceive the rotting corpse underneath the exterior shell.

In her more human-looking stage of appearance, she seems to have white skin, blue eyes and black hair, while wearing a pretty, white dress.

But the more unfocused someone's look becomes on her the more the pale and blotchy skin of a corpse, the stitches keeping her rotting body parts together and the matted and filthy strands of hair shine through. As well as talons on her fingers and sharp and very hungry teeth.

**Plans and Style**: Make mortal suffer for leaving their unliving relatives to rot and die in filth.

**Origin**: Many of the mortals could not bear to kill the Unliving their loved ones on the verge of death eventually become. And so they relinquish the nearly dead in the wilds to turn into the unliving and eventually be killed by someone else. One such place is a ravine the people of this world tend to toss their dead relatives into, therefrom the unliving born of their corpses can not return to do harm.

Invariably either forced to eat each other, feed on themselves or starve a lot of magic is collected in one place, whenever more than a few of the Unliving are tossed into the ravine. From this collective suffering and magical inferno rose Glypha.

**Further explanation**: Stitching together corpse flesh to make monsters. Terrify mortals for vengeance.

### Gon Gryn, Vengeance Reborn

**Player**: /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

**Spheres**: Earth and Vengeance

**Appearance**:
A tall and muscular half-bird, half-elven man - a race known as the Gryn - with earthy brown skin covered in bright white scars. The most noticeable of these is the scar over his left eye. In place of hair, he has a crest of feathers similar in appearance to a filled-in native american chief’s headdress. These feathers fade from a bright green to a vibrant purple, with three longer feathers fading from purple to green. Green eyes flecked with purple seem to be full of intensity and he usually wears an odd smirk. Below the knees his legs become those of an eagle and end in sharp black talons. Gon doesn’t seem particularly picky about what he wears, and can often be found wearing whatever clothes are provided to him by Lyva. He does slightly favor dressing in white, but for formal occasions he dresses in a green feather robe; a memento of his “father”. In battle, he wears traditional Arakyl feathermail over a purple padded tunic. The only thing he consistently has on his person is a particular sword known as The Retaliator with its plain dark leather sheath and belt.

**Plans and Style**:
Gon has only recently ascended into godhood and the shift from a demi-god to a full fledged divine being has left a mark on him. He intends to make the best of his new powers and rather simply enjoy himself. The fetters of fate, however, may not be so easy to sever.

Being the amnesiatic form of a god from another existence, Gon has a strange mix of apathy and curiosity about him. He has a knack for understanding magic and seeks it out with enthusiasm, but tends to laze around otherwise. Outwardly friendly, Gon only truly enjoys the company of those who have become consumed by some desire; he enjoys seeing them work tirelessly towards their goals. Especially if those goals include revenge.

**Origin**:
Gon was a semi-divine being created partially from the soul fragment of a god with the same name from the Fire Realm and the memories and personality of the phoenix god, Nekalos Toneyl. His former self was apparently destroyed along with Nek’s home realm, but the god attempted to achieve resurrection in a new plane of existence by placing a fragment of his soul in the banished phoenix god. Interference from the Serpent Goddess Celastra of Space, Secrets, and Shadows caused the plan to fail and Gon’s memories were stolen and placed into a demigoddess known as Lyva. Following the recreation of his body as a demigod, the amnesiatic Gon - known as Hunger - found himself somewhat enamored with the demigoddess and her greed. Seeking refuge from a dysfunctional family relationship with Nek and his demigoddess daughter, Hylatka, Hunger decided he would stay with Lyva. Once Lyva had achieved true divinity, Hunger agreed to travel away from the world with her to seek his own divinity elsewhere.

Divinity itself, however, has a price; as he traveled with Lyva, Gon was able to modify the so-called “Toneyl Divinity Manipulation Magic” developed by Hylatka and create a divine spark by siphoning the power of souls consumed by his blade into himself. Unfortunately, this seems to have had some side effects…

### Kain marson and Prismari

**Player** /u/Rhaegar1994 

**Appearance**: kain marson: an ageing god who looks to be in his mid-thirties who a slander face with short strawberry blonde stubble along with long unkept strawberry blonde hair. He is normally always smirking . Kain wears what once was a long white robes with intricate red and black embroidery that has faded to grey and stained with void like patches. His robe is armless To show off his unique arms that appear to be made of shadows for his left and light for his right from far away, but upon closer inspection the arm made of "shadow" is truly made of storm clouds and the one made of "light is truly made of a ice cold mist.

Prismari: in his natural form Prismari look is an ever shifting blob or ball of colour. But his favourite form would be  that of an androgynous human with prismatic eyes and long rainbow hair that was about the age of eighteen. With a  cloak that has hints of colour but mostly has fade from traveling the void and is just  now black. Shockingly enough when compared to kain one could almost see a familial resemblance 

**Spheres**: storm and heroes 

**Plans and Style**: for my plans I shall be making some sort of hero based metaphysic, Along with a adventurer/ hero’s guild to possibly be my main source of worship . As for storm related stuff. I’ll likely make a metaphysic for it as well as an eternal storm or something a long the lines. 

**Origin**: kain a father whom lost his child and searched the multiverses, he finally found the lost child only to lose him as he left with a lady friend. But as luck would have it seemed prismari and lyva where separated some how well traveling the void and was rescued by his father refused to tell the child they where family but offered to help track down lyva and teach the godling a thing or two along the way

### Lyva

**Player:** /u/Smcadam       

**Spheres:** Greed and Metal     
             
**Appearance**: Lyva’s usual form is an athletic metallic goddess with curling horns amidst her long hair, and a long tail. Various panels and scales on her can open like drawers and doors to a pocket dimension where she hoards and collects… well, anything that catches her attention.                        
She normally flaunts her wealth by wearing a vast diversity of jewellery and dresses. She can shapeshift, normally changing what metal she seems composed of, or turning into a metallic asian style dragon occasionally.      

**Origin**: Lyva was originally “born” in a divine accident, from another deities greed breaking off. She’s tempered a little bit by wisdom and cunning since her birth, but fundamentally just wants everything. She quickly acquired adoptive parents, friends and lovers, and used them to ascend to full godhood, before leaving to claim her own planet.

### Oryllia, the Witch-Queen

**Player**: /u/DragoneyeCreations

**Spheres**: Hexes and Contracts

**Appearance**: Oryllia appears as a feminine figure made of violet fire, with metallic pieces adorning her like armor. Most notably, a plate with long curling horns covers her eyes like a blindfold. She wields a hammer, covered in runes.

**Plans and Style**: Oryllia, being a goddess of hexes and contracts, seeks to curse both the land and individuals through various means. She lures mortals in via contracts with her, which will nearly always end in the mortal being cursed. Primarily, she will be feared, and those who actively worship her will be those pushed to the fringes of society for being profane.

**Origins**: Oryllia was born out of the dregs of creation, the profanity, the sludge that soon became the pit from which all of her Hexes came from.

**Further Explanation**: Oryllia is an evil aligned god, so expect plenty of chaos to come from her. It’ll be a mix of simple tricks and horrendous evil.

### Rictus

**Spheres**: Law and Hunt

**Description**: Rictus generally appears in human form. The form of the man he was born as. He is of a tall but lean build and is clothed in the leather garb of a hunter. He has shoulder long, brown hair with gray streaks. He wears his hair bound back behind his head in a braid. Rictus has blue-gray eyes and a thick, full beard. His beard has the same color as his hair. The right half of his face is scarred with a big claw mark.

When he appears as the god of the hunt he often wears a green cloak. This hides his face in darkness under the cloaks hood, showing only the eyes of a predator, glowing in the dark of the hood. He also carries the full apparel of a hunter.

When he appears as the god of law he appears in armor and wearing a heavy pelt coat, carrying an executioner's sword and a law book, seemingly made from iron.

**Personality**: Rictus despite his ascension millennia ago still is mostly like the mortal man he once was. Rictus likes to look out for his people and see that they are provided for as he always has as one of the hunters of his hometown. On the other hand he is unmoving in punishing those that break the laws and that endanger the well-being of people at large.

**Background**: Rictus grew up in a small town in the mountains. Later on he had learned the trade of a hunter.

He lead the typical life of a human. He had a family. He was involved in occasional fights. He aged and slowed down, but gained in experience. He joined the elders of his hometown. Rictus learned to value the peace and sense of community, so everyone could work and live in relative prosperity. As far as was possible in a part of the world regularly plagued by raiders, vampires and ghouls. 

One day a group of wandering monks called the Logothets had marched through his hometown. Rictus listened and learned from the Logothets about the nature of reality and divinity as taught by the god called the Outsider. Mortals were normally not privy to such information

For Rictus all this discussion was too theoretical. It was a bunch of talk about the theoretical construct of the mind and the makeup of nature as a whole. Nothing that really helped him in doing his duty. Though he never really forgot what he he had heard.

The priests had wandered on disappointed. Rictus however spent much of his time contemplating the words of the Logothets, when he was out alone at night. Or sitting and waiting for the best shot on one of his hunts.

During a hunting accident where he was shot and left for dead by another hunter. He lay in the snow bleeding and feeling his live drift away. So he started praying for his family, that they were taken care of. To the gods so that he might find a good place in the afterlife. Ans so he started remembering the words of all the priests he had heard. In his hour of death he could feel the words of the Logothets from so long ago gain a new dimension. He felt something happening. A deep understanding of the world around filled him. He felt, that if he reached out he could touch things that normally were only abstracts to mortals.

In his life he had been familiar with two things, hunting and the law. He reached out for the understanding of these things he knew so well. And so he ascended.

He left his homeworld after an apocalyptic war against a god called the Shadow. And while the war was won and the Shadow vanquished the world became hostile to gods. And so he moved to a new world. Where he created humanity and built a world for mortals confronting another great evil alongside fellow divine beings called the Master of the Abyss.

Wherever Rictus turned those bent on unjust destruction and domination seemed to abound. And with the world safe once more he decided to strike out and do what he did best, bring the law to protect people and hunt down those who broke it.

### The Sorcerer

**Plans and Style:** Magic, Death and the Afterlife are linked. Expect to see as much in-game.

In the absence of his once patron deity, he himself took over the leadership of his people. And now he wanders the multiverse in search of a new world that could make an apt permanent home for his people, after their erstwhile world suffered catastrophe after catastrophe.

**Further Explanation:** The Sorcerer was once an idealistic youth trying to follow in his patron's footsteps to be a force of good. Repeated betrayals by his closest allies have made him pragmatic and weary and have shifted his focus from looking out for everyone to looking out for his people.
