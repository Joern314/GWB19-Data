## Artifacts

### The Blood Dagger

**Creator**: Azrakal (/u/Plintstorm ) 

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgrobm/)

**Description**: A dagger forged with the scales of Lyva and the Blood of Azrakal. The Dagger absorbs blood, including that inside the people it stab.

###Blade of the First King

/u/Plintstorm 

[Turn 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/fltg5sc/)

**Description:** Blade of the first King of the world. Can only be held by people with Kings blood or close to getting Kings blood.  
A unusually powerful sword.

### The Retaliator

**Creator**: ??? ( /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW ) 

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flg98lz/)

**Description**: 
A feather shaped blade that has turned to pitch black obsidian after being used in a ritual to ascend to godhood. A fuller ran the length of the blade and formed what would have been the stem of the feather. The shining brass or gold guard was formed in the shape of wings, the handle wrapped in a what had become rough blackened leather in a criss-cross fasion, and the pommel was in the shape of a bird's head with three eyes. Each eye was a different gemstone; emerald, ruby, and diamond.

The Retaliator was sword of divine creation that Gon brought along with him from another world. Having lost its old patron and having being used as a catalyst to create Gon's spark of divinity, it had been rendered powerless and immaterial.

**Blessings**: 0 (The blade exists as a part of Gon's divine form only, for now.)

### Arrow Spells

/u/Horatius-Cocles 

[Turn 5](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fmbyy5j/)

- Armor Piercer: An arrow with increased piercing power versus armor or big beasts.

- Delayed Arrow: Freezes in the air when shot and only takes flight after a delay, allowing the archer to hide or change positions.

- Splitting Arrow: Splits into 3 in flight and hits target thrice.


###Blood Storage

/u/Plintstorm 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flxvou2/)

**Description:** Magic used to store magics in blood. Stores magic for 1 year and 1 day.

###Blood Empowerment

/u/Plintstorm 

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fm7wgzs/)

**Description:** By killing a creature, be it man or beast, one can then drink it's blood in a magical ritual to gain it's power.  
While only a small amount of it's total power is gained, it is permanent and can be repeated.

### Magic Arrows

/u/Horatius-Cocles 

[Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flnbg3y/)

Magical Arrows who can absorb magical energies upon killing something, so it does not explode. Magical energy is stored in the arrow until discharged. This is a secret magic and does not become general knowledge. Can only be learned by bargaining with Rictus or buying it directly for 3 acts + 2 acts for secrecy.

### The Mindburn spell

As the Vazari experimented with their mental ability to dominate others, they found that, if magic was used to amplify their attempt at domination, it could not only dominate a person, but burn out any personal memories that the target possessed while leaving the majority of what made them useful, such as the knowledge of how to craft things or what type of foods where toxic, while leaving them unable to remember who even their closest friends or family.

The Vazari turned to using this spell as a way to punish their more heinous criminals whose skills were valuable or rare, enough so that consigning them to unliving status outweighed the benefit of imposing more lethal punishments. In effect this spell could only be used legally after a fair trial was conducted by the judging of their peers and after the ritual was completed, the criminal was treated as a reborn person, given a new name and adopted or auctioned off into a family or other tribe that desired their skills so that the victims of the crimes would not have to deal with seeing the perpetrator day in and day out.
### Petrification Magic

/u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

[Turn 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fmb4yly/)

This required the caster to take in the magic from an unliving creature who had been put down and redirect that energy to their target.

Petrification magic was not instant and could only be used from a short distance, but the living/unliving would slowly turn to stone from the point that the magic was directed to, until they had been rendered into nothing more than a statue. This spell does not permit this to be undone. To prevent becoming a statue, one must rid themselves of all of the parts that have started to turn to stone.

### The Sorcerer's Runes

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fm8mb06/)

Runic markings taught to mortals by the Sorcerer. If fed with magical energy by killing something of by a store the runes can be charged and used to their magical purposes until depleted. At which point they need to be recharged again.

- Rune Pyxos: Putting it on an object makes it more durable for a while. While a living thing can carry heavier loads.

- Rune Akribeia: Putting it on an object this enchantment makes a tool or weapon exert more force when used. While it heightens someones precision with a tool or weapon if put on a living thing. 

- Rune Fora: Putting it on a living thing this spell boosts its stamina. For missiles and vehicles it boosts their speed.

####Secret Runes

#####Necrurgy

/u/Gwydion-Drys

[Turn 6](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fv4ovs/endless_pantheon_turn_6/fmhla43/)

Dead and dying people and animals often carry skills or training that would be wasted with the dead. A mage capable of necrurgy can remove parts of the soul from a recently dead person or animal and implant them in a living person or animal. 

In people memories of the deceased or dying often will be transported alongside the skill or ability the mage wants to transplant. 

In animals, character traits are often transferred. So the ferocity of one animal might be transferred onto another.

This is the drawback of this magic if it is misused, employed too often on the same target or performed badly, Necrurgy can lead to mental illness, most often multiple personality disorder. (5 acts for magic + 2 for secret)

## Metaphysics

### Fidelity

**Creator**: Yashqal(/u/hpllamacrft)

**Created**: [Turn 1]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flhz5pr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**Description**: The true essence of all things, which can be mimicked to induce transformation. 

Every thing has a core essence. This essence can be perceived by the outward characteristics of a thing. Creatures can change their own core essence by dancing in a way that mimics the core essence of another thing. This is called showing fidelity. By showing fidelity to a thing one adopts a thing’s outward characteristics to a limited degree.
For example, a mortal looking to become tougher may show fidelity to a boulder. From observing the boulder they invent a boulder dance that captures the essence of boulders. Then the mortal practices this boulder dance for years; his skin grows tough and he is able to withstand strikes with greater resistance. In the same way, a fox dance may make someone stealthier, the gazelle dance may make someone more beautiful, the fruit dance may make someone more fertile.

### Knitting Flesh

/u/Senelaria

[Turn 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlgpm/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro_act_log/fmahxwh/)

Among mortals only the jumbled can make use of the powers this metaphysic bestows. It allows a jumbled to take body parts cut off of another person or corpse and sew them together. A living person can so be given use of a replacement limb if they lost their own.

If a jumbled sews together a roughly humanoid form from corpse or body parts the resulting body comes alive as a jumbled themself. The jumbled live a relatively normal mortal life with a normal life span, the only caveat being they can only reproduce by knitting together a new jumbled. Biologically these new jumbled can however perform any other task a normal human, goblin or whater flesh was used in their creation, can. (Even sex.)

### Legends of the heroes

**Creator**: Kain  & prismari 

**created**: [turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgnymn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

**The Law**: Mortals who embrace their Legend shall grow stronger as it grows, but Legends never die.

**Explanation**: When a Non-Incarnate Mortal has the desire to change the world, they open themselves up to the Legends of the heroes . Specifically, they open up the possibility to build their Personal heroic Legend. This turns them into a Heroic Mortal. Heroic Mortals do not need to be "Good" or "Evil," they only need the desire to make a change in the world.

Heroic Mortals grow their Legend by growing their reputation (or fame) in the eyes of other mortals. However, Legend will only grow if you actually did what people think you did. You can't just claim credit for what other people do. Your Legend will not grow if you are anonymous either, people need a name to attach to your deeds in order for you to gain Legend. That name can be a pseudonym, though.
Heroic Mortals are able to draw upon their Legend to fuel greater deeds. Those with powerful Legends will be able to achieve superhuman feats, although they will never get strong enough to solo a Demigod. This can become a self-reinforcing feedback loop of Greater Powers leading to Greater Deeds leading to Greater Powers.
There is a cost to Heroism. Heroes Never traditionally Die, but are instead consumed by their Legend. Sure there body may pass with a magical explosion which depending on the size of the legend may be larger and become a unliving but yet A small portion of Their souls will never pass on to an Afterlife, but will instead linger as a portion of their Legend, In the form of an artifact that can gift future heroes with a bit of past heroes abilities. These artifacts cost players at the least 2 acts 


### Life after Death

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgku2r/)

**Creator**: The Sorcerer

**Amended**: -

**Description**: In accordance with the laws of thermodynamics energy can not be created or destroyed only displaced and transformed. The energy of life permeating mortal bodies does not fade with death.

In animals the energy once keeping them alive turns into magical energy. The one and only source for everything magical. This magical energy has only a very short halflife and dissipates into the surrounding world as light and heat energy.

Once a mortal has reached the end of his/her/its natural life span or is killed in another way the soul is separated from the body. The body however does not die off. It is transformed into a so called “Unliving”.

The Unliving are feral beings not unlike zombies, but instead of rotting they are functionally alive bodies without minds beyond those of primitive animals only set on sating their base desires like food, drink and procreation.

If an Unliving is killed its animating force turns into magical energy as well. The transformation from magical energy to heat and light occurs in seconds. An Unliving explodes with the force of a grenade and the smaller the animal the less force/ magic is released.

To kill an Unliving its brain needs to be destroyed. Any parts attached to the head stay active.

Unclaimed souls and those claimed by the Sorcerer are after death escorted to the afterlife in the “Rift”, the Sorcerer's plane, by the mortals inhabiting the Rift and only those inhabiting the Rift.

The Unliving yearn to sate all their animal desires including food, sleep and sex at all costs. They are however biologically mortal and produce mortal children.

### Power of Blood

/u/Plintstorm 

[Turn 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flnix1j/)

**Description:** Power rest in blood, more powerful people have more powerful blood. Heroes, Kings and other figures of power and authority have power in their blood, making them physically more powerful.  
Power is just not strength, but also a general meaning of power. Kings blood makes for good king in several aspect.  
Blood can also be applied to people and objects to increase their power temporarily.

### The Thirteen Hexes

**Creator**: Oryllia(/u/DragoneyeCreations)

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flhf0w8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**Description**: ~~A set of thirteen distinct blights upon the world, forged by the primordial dregs of creation.~~

The Hexes were undone by Oryllia, after an immense crisis of guilt and an encounter with Lyva.

#### ~~Hex 1 - The Soil Shrieks~~

~~Every time a region of the world is covered in darkness, the air is filled with bloodcurdling screams.~~

### Tsukumogami, or Familial Bonding

**Creator**: /u/Abacadaren

**Created**: [Turn 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flte821/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=GodhoodWB&utm_content=t1_flsx2v4)

**Description**: Items gain power based off the time that it spends with its owner who gives special care and attention to it (Whether positive or negative). Items can be passed on to family members which regress the years to halfway through the previous phase (Excluding the final phase). For all intents and purposes aside from worship, items that have bonded to the 100+ years phase are mortals.

Years Owned | Power
:--|:--:
1-32| Easier/Harder maintenance, can make small jumps/jerks of motion, Aware of who owns it
33-66| Finer control of self, can provide the feeling of an emotion to its owner, able to "see" up to 5 ft away (Blindsight 5 ft), and weak special abilities based off of what the item is (Mirror can control its reflection, cooking knife can auto-chop ingredients as long as its held, stuffed animals can make animal noises)
67-99| Can do multiple actions in a row, Can provide concepts/ideas to owner, Blindsight 10 ft, special abilities are strengthened
100+| Full control of self like any person would have control over their body, Sentient personality based off of experience and owner(s), able to communicate with those around it, Blindsight 20 ft, Can be passed on to family or friends without any regression of power. Item never losses its sentience or ability unless destroyed

Of note, hero artifacts are spawned from a soul and as such aren't fully inanimate objects to be affected by this metaphysics, but things like artifacts can be

### Theurgy - Cantrips

/u/Gwydion-Drys 

[Turn 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fm8mb06/)

These spells can be cast by anyone. Up to three times per day any combination of these cantrips can be used. They are influenced by the gods and their domains and allows mortals to channel magical power in an imitation of divine power for the following purposes:

God | Cantrip
:--|:--|
|**Azrakal** (Blood &amp; Power)|Consume blood for short boost of endurance.|
|**Dawri** (Fate &amp; Time)|Divination on planned events can give a feeling about it going right or wrong.|
|**The Forgotten** (Lost Things &amp; Sentiments)|Mend items with sentimental value.|
|**Glypha** (Fear &amp; Flesh)|Evoke fear by illusion of rotten flesh.|

|**Thool** (Seasons &amp; Trees)|Disappear/ hide between trees.|
|**Yashqal** (Dance &amp; Mimicry)|Mimic someone's voice or a sound.|

(As magical power is channeled there still needs to be killed something before use of a cantrip or the caster needs a store of magical power of some kind.

## Miracles

### The Iron Law

/u/Horatius-Cocles 

[Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgku2r/)

At any time there are a number of individuals (number will grow with time and a bigger population), chosen by Radamanthys the minor god of judges. 

People found worthy by Radamanthys gain knowledge of the law as laid down in Rictus' Iron Codex. Most people can only use the powers of an Iron Judge to enforce the Iron Law as laid down in the Iron Codex.

But due to an unexpected interference between the blood metaphysic making people more powerful and the strange metaphysics of this new world, Iron Judges who gain positions as nobles, kings, high government officials, etc gain the ability to interpret the Iron Law more flexible or in very rare cases to choose another altogether different set of laws of their own choosing to enforce.

While most people chosen by Radamanthys will stay their course and stick to the Iron Law, the power may corrupt some few individuals who use their powers not in the service of the Iron Law, but for themselves or their chosen codices of law. It falls to the Iron Inquisitors to root out these corrupt judges.

Iron Inquisitors are tasked with special duties by the god Rictus, among the most important is the neutralizing of renegade Iron Judges, who don't use their powers for justice and in unethical ways.

The Iron Judges, in turn, are bound to the strict nature of the Iron Law and are provided with knowledge of how to interpret the Law correctly and in extension how to give and render judgment correctly. After an impartial investigation of course. If a judge fails to comply with this, he is stripped of his rank and judged by an Iron Inquisitor accordingly to the Iron Law and replaced by an individual found worthy to serve. The ousted former judge then loses all his powers.

The Law is independent thereby subject to no one and to be obeyed by all. The Judges by extensions are only subject to the Iron Law, and while they may choose to worship any god and follow any mortal individual they desire, they still have to render judgment even of their king if the Iron Law demands it. 

By extension, the Judges are not susceptible to being mind-controlled or influenced even by the divine. While a god can still smite a judge, if they wish to do so, they can not in any other way interfere with a judge's work. The free will and action of a judge can NOT be tampered with under any circumstances in as far as it pertains to his duties as an Iron Judge. Their free and honest judgment in accordance with the Iron Law is a judge's first duty.

While in an ideal world everyone would live by the rule of law, many people or their gods don't support the Iron Law [yet].

The Law and its judges can render judgment on anyone who breaks the Iron Law. To do this the Judges are given the power to make reality around them conform to the Iron Law.
For example, if the Iron Law forbids the carrying of weapons, the presence of an Iron Judge would make it impossible to bear arms. Anyone carrying a weapon would find themselves unable to lift or draw the weapon. The Iron Judge would then proceed to the judgment and the meting out of punishment for the transgression of bearing arms. For a judges powers to take effect they need to proclaim a verdict by any reasonable form of communication, meaning even writing and sign language would work.

To use this power however an Iron Judge has to know one of the Iron Laws is broken. He has to be near the infraction to fix it and using this power is taxing. The greater the change to reality, the greater the fatigue a judge incurs after using this power. This can even lead to death.

However, if the cause of an infraction is supernatural the power can be fueled by energies of the supernatural entity/ magic that said infraction is coming from, not taxing the judge as much in using their power.

The only circumstance under which judgment/ punishment can be avoided to be given by an Iron Judge is to prevent greater and heavier consequences than letting crime go unpunished.

Lastly fast and swift action is often necessary. If there is a threat too big to be handled by Iron Judges or to the Iron Law itself an Iron Inquisitor can be called. Iron Inquisitors carry all the powers of the Iron Judges are for the duration of their missions however exempt from judgment themselves. They can, however, be judged after their missions are finished and their status as Iron Inquisitors revoked.

In a state of extreme emergency, where the Law isn't only threatened but can be considered non-existent because of the reigning disorder. An Iron Inquisitor can name Lawbringers.

Lawbringers are endowed with the power to actively bend reality to bring order into chaos. Where the Iron Judges can only bend reality to conform to law, a Lawbringer can bend reality to what it should be in the Lawbringer's eyes.

These powers can be revoked by an Iron Inquisitor or withdrawn by the miracle itself, if grossly misused.

The strain put on Lawbringers is the same or even greater as that put on Judges, when they bend reality.

### Waidmänner

/u/Horatius-Cocles 

[Turn 5](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fmbyy5j/)

Warriors serving as the armed wing of Order of Iron Judges to enforce the law and as agents to the demigod Ferus, the Waidmänner receive their power by being chosen to serve by the Iron Judges or Ferus. The Waidmänner are gifted the abilities to be deadly hunters and warriors to boot.

- Hunting Intuition: The Waidmann possesses extraordinary instincts, allowing them supernatural tracking abilities and more accurate senses. Their senses are in fact so sharp: If they can see, hear, smell or in any other way perceive their target, they can deduce knowledge about their target like is the target human, what age, injuries and weakness to exploit, is the target hostile or a danger.

- Stealth Tactics: The Waidmann is very knowledgeable in stealth and hunting tactics and master them to perfection. Beyond that someone guilty of breaking the Iron Law has a harder time detecting the Waidmann, to aid in the offenders apprehension or to more easily serve justice. 

- Weaponsmastery: The Waidmann is a master in the use of their hunting implements. It doesn't matter if bow, cannon, spear or knife. The Waidmann knows instinctively how to use whatever tool is at hand to capture or incapacitate his chosen prey.

- Trophies: Any Waidmann can perform this hunting ritual. In which he has to slay prey shown to him in a vision. The Hunt has to be undertaken without resources or any form of supernatural or divine powers and only things or powers acquired during the quest can be used for the hunt. If the quest is completed successfully the Waidmann gains some of the power of his prey. This effect is accumulative.

 So an experienced Waidmann, who has gone though the ritual several times, will have a number of powers like night vision, or the enhanced senses and strength of an animal, or things as straightforward as retractable claws. Any new cycle however will be more difficult than the last.

## Planes

### The Rift

**Creator**: The Sorcerer

**Amended**: -

**Description**: The Sorcerer's very own plane between worlds. For the souls of the dead it functions as an afterlife for the Apokryph it is their home dimension. 

The Rift is a volatile, shifting and twisted mirror version of the material world. It grows and changes as the material plane does. The Rift is a place born of Magic and Death. The **Endless Woods** make up the majority of the plane. It is steeped in eternal darkness. The terrain is unreliable and distances change at will. Where an hour ago a river was flowing now a mountain could be standing.

At the center of the plane, suspended in mid air instead of a sun hovers a white city, **Oneiros**, the city of sleep.

Three kinds of dead souls are found in the Rift:

- The first are souls with no other afterlife to go to.

- The second are the faithful of the Sorcerer.

- The third are the souls of the dead Apokryph, waiting for reincarnation.

The first two kinds are judged and either allowed entrance to Oneiros, where they can sleep and dream away the time. 

If they are found unworthy they are tossed into the Endless Woods where they are forced to prey on each for eternity, while their worst nightmares take shape and torment all of them equally.

The third kind live among their living kin, but are unable to leave the Rift.

Beyond that the Rift connects to all Rift Woods of the material world. Mortals, who know how and dare to enter, will be able to go to this plane through the Rift Woods. Then they can wander the Rift until they reach a place connecting to a different patch of Rift Wood and return through there to the material plane or they find the hidden way to Oneiros, where they can try to reach their dead loved ones.

While people not privy to the secrets of mastering the Rift Woods and the Rift will be in danger of stumbling blind into this plane and never come back. Because they run afoul of the dangers of the Endless Woods, wandering through the Rift until they die. Or they stumble back into the mortal world in a random patch of Rift Wood, possibly on the opposite side of the world, driven mad by the horrors of the Endless Woods. Creatures and plants can make their way around the world in this way as well and wander into the Rift, where they become inhabitants of the Rift itself. 

Upon significant events in the material world, like the founding of an important city, a battle or the creation of an especially holy sight etc., a similar location will come into existence in a corresponding place in the Rift. Negative events like battles or especially grisly murders spawn a place haunted by the deepest and darkest horrors of the Rift. While positive events like an especially heroic act or similar things will create one of the rare sanctuaries of the Rift. Here mortals and other beings wandering the Rift can find a safe haven for a short while. As with all places in the Rift, these suffer from volatile topography and shifting surroundings as well. Unless guided by someone in the know it is highly unlikely for people to come out of the Rift in one piece.

#### Locations in the Rift

**Oneiros, the City of Sleep**: At the center of the plane, suspended in mid air, hovers a white city, Oneiros, the city of sleep. Here those who have earned a reward, dream away the time. It is also the primary home of the Apokryph in the Rift.

**Endless Woods**: A woodland haunted by those deemed unworthy to enter Oneiros. It is overrun by the nightmares of the Damned, who are forced to prey on each other for eternity. The topography and geography is permanently shifting and the Woods are shrouded in near complete darkness.

**Rift Woods**: Patches of crystalline tree like structures that grow in wooded areas on land or coral reefs under water. They can be found in the material plane and the Rift. These patches of crystalline woods mark the entrances/exits of the Rift.
