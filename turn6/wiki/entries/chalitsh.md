The trade route between Rahaâ€™stal and Wooxti-Kwashotl ran overland through the jungle and over the mountain range of Primus. This spawned a hospitality industry catering to merchants making the months-long journey on horseback. The Crater of Thool was one such popular stop, so was Chalitsh to the West, a Kwashotl yashool settlement at the confluence of the Bakwagalis and its tributary. They received a Black Wing governor from Shata in the year 5, and their appointments continued to come from the capital.
