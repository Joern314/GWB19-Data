# Blood Riders Soceity [Cultures]

Description: A collection of many different tribes living in the blood plains. Nomadic, herding deer and riding horses.

**Values:** The Blood Riders value strength and action. A stronger leader is far more respected then a wise or intelligent leader.  
Practical skills are also valued highly, ridding skill, leather-working, and fighting skills.

**Structures:** The blood riders are separated in to many different tribes. While each one might have it's own custom and ways, they all value strength. As such, the chief tends to be the strongest warriors in the tribe, while the title often goes from father to son, it's not unusual for it to see the chief be challenged and defeated.  
Alliances and blood feuds are common and change often, being so focused on the now and living life fully, they often do not focus on generation old grudges, if the oldest member of a tribe that remembers the original grudge dies, it often vanish with him.

**Location:** Located all over the blood plains.
