# Civil Defense [The City on the Well]
All men and women who live within the walls of Gwanyin are trained in the Basic Arts of War. 

The City supplies each person with a Spear, a Shield, a bow, and basic armor. Craftsmen and other wealthy individuals are expected to outfit themselves in more exceptional equipment. Professional Soldiers are selected from members of the Labor Class who show exceptional aptitude at War, and Officers are promoted form their ranks. Professional Soldiers are given equipment suited to their role, and spend their peace-time as a Guard-Force within the city.

Everyone old enough to train is expected, and scheduled, to report to one of the City's Mustering Grounds once a week. These Courtyards are located next to the Temple of Life, and they are large enough for a force of men to practice moving in formation, combat in formation, and then split off for one-on-one sparring. The practice is overseen by a member of the Order of War, who is enjoying a day off from *their* training to spread their wisdom to lesser warriors.

In the event of the City coming under attack, every man and woman within its walls is capable of joining the defense. Only Artisans, such as Blacksmiths and Architects, are expected to remain off the walls in such an event. Their *knowledge* and skill is seen as too valuable to risk in battle.
