The most powerful of all the Nkarlen tribes, the Mogimal control the Nkarlen capital city of Kzivo'gbamo and the temple-caves of Nkan'gbamo below. This underground city dominates Nkarlen culture and is the seat of all the Jikzeks; the leaders of the Ranos. 

Other settlements/cities include: Lakzekond at the eastern end of the shattered mountains
