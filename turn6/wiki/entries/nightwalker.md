**Description:** The Nightwalker is a symbiotic predator. In its primary form, it is similar to a wolf stalking through the utter darkness of the Endless Woods in the Rift. On occasion one or a few of these creatures might venture into the material plane but only occasionally.

If an individual mortal is able to fend off this wolf-like creature it takes gooey form and tries to bond itself to the person. The bonding process acts like sickness and kills the host through ensuing fever and auto-immune reactions. In 1 out of 10 cases however, the Nightwalker forms a symbiotic relationship with the host.

The bond with the Nightwalker endows it's with a sense of echolocation, though interpreting the new sensory input takes time and experience. The immune system of the host is also strengthened somewhat after fighting off the infection like the bonding process and their blood turns slightly acidic.
