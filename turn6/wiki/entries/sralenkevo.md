**Sphere**: Mercy

**Description**:
A tag along that stays with Gon and acts like the angel on his right shoulder. She appears as the thing that the onlooker would have the hardest time hurting or as a gentle angel if that doesn't work and she wishes to reveal herself.

Reminds Gon of his "mother", Vera, who was the only part of his family that fully accepted him, despite their differences in spheres. Often gets into arguements with the Minor God of Hatred.
