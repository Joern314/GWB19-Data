# The Rift [Planes]

**Creator**: The Sorcerer

**Amended**: -

**Description**: The Sorcerer's very own plane between worlds. For the souls of the dead it functions as an afterlife for the Apokryph it is their home dimension. 

The Rift is a volatile, shifting and twisted mirror version of the material world. It grows and changes as the material plane does. The Rift is a place born of Magic and Death. The **Endless Woods** make up the majority of the plane. It is steeped in eternal darkness. The terrain is unreliable and distances change at will. Where an hour ago a river was flowing now a mountain could be standing.

At the center of the plane, suspended in mid air instead of a sun hovers a white city, **Oneiros**, the city of sleep.

Three kinds of dead souls are found in the Rift:

- The first are souls with no other afterlife to go to.

- The second are the faithful of the Sorcerer.

- The third are the souls of the dead Apokryph, waiting for reincarnation.

The first two kinds are judged and either allowed entrance to Oneiros, where they can sleep and dream away the time. 

If they are found unworthy they are tossed into the Endless Woods where they are forced to prey on each for eternity, while their worst nightmares take shape and torment all of them equally.

The third kind live among their living kin, but are unable to leave the Rift.

Beyond that the Rift connects to all Rift Woods of the material world. Mortals, who know how and dare to enter, will be able to go to this plane through the Rift Woods. Then they can wander the Rift until they reach a place connecting to a different patch of Rift Wood and return through there to the material plane or they find the hidden way to Oneiros, where they can try to reach their dead loved ones.

While people not privy to the secrets of mastering the Rift Woods and the Rift will be in danger of stumbling blind into this plane and never come back. Because they run afoul of the dangers of the Endless Woods, wandering through the Rift until they die. Or they stumble back into the mortal world in a random patch of Rift Wood, possibly on the opposite side of the world, driven mad by the horrors of the Endless Woods. Creatures and plants can make their way around the world in this way as well and wander into the Rift, where they become inhabitants of the Rift itself. 

Upon significant events in the material world, like the founding of an important city, a battle or the creation of an especially holy sight etc., a similar location will come into existence in a corresponding place in the Rift. Negative events like battles or especially grisly murders spawn a place haunted by the deepest and darkest horrors of the Rift. While positive events like an especially heroic act or similar things will create one of the rare sanctuaries of the Rift. Here mortals and other beings wandering the Rift can find a safe haven for a short while. As with all places in the Rift, these suffer from volatile topography and shifting surroundings as well. Unless guided by someone in the know it is highly unlikely for people to come out of the Rift in one piece.
