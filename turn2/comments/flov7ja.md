Sarah turned. She wasn't exactly surprised to see... Lyva, was it? But she didn't expect her, either. "Greetings, Lyva." she said. "My name is Sarah, Goddess of Protection and Darkness." she knew that the formal introduction was more for the mortals then her, but she still felt it was polite to introduce herself properly. "I accept your thanks. Perhaps you could help me a little? I fear that I need some guidance regarding the mortals and everything in general. I don't ask it in return to what I did, so feel free to refuse."
