As Malaphet drifted in space, or perhaps space drifted in him, he began to notice these lesser deities deities appearing and being approached by the beings he had for the most part already encountered, curious about this new development on his unfinished meal heintently watched, so intently in fact, that he nearly missed one appearing near the "moon" that he had made at the request of the strange being that transformed. As he refocused on the moon he found what looked like the vague outline of a humanoid man except it's limbs merely floated around the body, not actually connected in any tangible way. This new entity was staring at the moon and occasionally adjusting it.

"(Incomprehensible gibberish)" Malaphet rumbled at the new entity

"Oh hello there big guy, don't mind me just doing my job, making sure this hunk o'bone doesn't fall on the planet." The entity replied without really looking at Malaphet.

"(Incomprehensible gibberish)" Malaphet rumbled again.

"Ahh yes, I am Ophis, Minor God or Orbits, a pleasure to make your aquaintance. As a further note, I'd appreciate it if you gave me a heads up next time you made something floating around in the void, it's so incredibly difficult to adjust things when you just drop them around all willy nilly." Ophis spoke again, still concentrating on adjusting the moon.

"(Incomprehensible gibberish)" Malaphet rumbled again as he moved his attention away from the entity.

"Yes yes, good bye, see you later!" Called Ophis as Malaphet left
