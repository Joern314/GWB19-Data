[ you create an artifact. For costs you just add together blessing costs (the act cost table has examples for reference). Mundane parts (a metal sword) are free. The blessings don't need to come from your spheres alone but I am happy if the artifact fits your general theme (and your spheres). As usual intruding on other players' spheres (e.g. a blood-powered sword) needs their approval/they get a veto right. 

[ I don't think the god of War owns all weapons, so he won't mind a divine weapon.]

[ If you describe on discord what your weapon should do, others and me can suggest the total costs. Usually there is some tweaking until the artifact is as powerful/costly as you want it to be]

[ Restrictions on who can use a weapon (e.g. it can only be used to protect) are something like 3 acts, not sure if you want that safety measure?, the strength to cut through metal chains/obstacles is another 3 acts. Although magical materials might prove better than the sword. You can add more blessings when needed]

[Providing the shields is free, as they won't survive to turn 3.]
