"Good. I didn't want to doubt you, I'm glad I was right." The younger goddess nodded, settling down crosslegged with her tail hugged close as she thought.

"There's two- well, three possible suspects I know of, but I've yet to meet everyone in this realm. Malaphet is also hungry, and I made a deal with him that we would cooperate to build the physical world, but Oryllia witnessed that deal so I and he should share the rewards- their worship and souls. I think Oryllia would know if he betrayed me."

"There's also Nedaline, a Goddess of *Thievery*, she's been enjoying teasing me. But I'm not sure that she'd be capable of stealing worship from both of us."

"Then there's my cousin, the great snake by the sun. She's... very dim, but she's old and mature, and she mentioned waiting until any other gods had starved before she laid her egg. I assumed she was being... well, stupid, but if this keeps up, then we will starve, so it matches her threat."
