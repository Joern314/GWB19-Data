Kain on the other hand flew into the sky his eyes black as the void he decided to open his assault by drawing on his connection to Prismari and tapping in to the heroes sphere to combine it with his storm sphere 

The precipitation in the air froze as if in the middle of a hail storm. But kain wasn’t just channeling storms no with the heroes sphere aid ,  the pellets of hail began to  collect and form into shapes as it become hundreds of hail like weapons. They where  imitations weapons of heroes and gods from the past worlds kain has visited  

With a snap of his finger kain sent the hail weapons forward in to the darkness with a wind speed of 254 mph 

He then proceeded to create a wall of lightning in the sky over the city  to slow the god further
