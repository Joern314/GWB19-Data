For a while Gon didn't respond, until finally he softened his face and let out a heavy sigh.

"Perhaps..." Gon replied hesitantly, as he tapped the hilt of his sword in thought and straightened a errant feather on his head. "But I still owe you for your help... and Lyva wouldn't... but to deny soneone vengeance... I... We will have to see."

"Srukzek, what a mess!" Gon yelled to relieve some frustration and then forced himself to smile again.

"I will not make this decision now; for all we know, this Azrakal may never seek me out. Then, I suppose, I won't ever have to figure this out."

"Thank you for telling me what happened, Prismari." Gon sighed again, glanced away, and folded his arms. "Lies would make the call for vengeance harder for me to ignore... like... adding a weight to the other side."
