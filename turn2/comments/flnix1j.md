#Crisis: Worship of the Divine

Azrakal was walking with Sarash next to him.  
He had been planning. He knew something was to come from the mortals, but they were not.

Clearly, this needed to be rectified. Maybe it is just not strong enough?

He went to the new born Apokryphs. He watched him, Sarash wanted to know what the plan was, more pain was needed more suffering.

So Azrakal went to the Apokryphs.  
He introduced himself, a man flayed for the things he had done and that he wanted blood, at first, the Apokryphs was scared. But Azrakal said he could not kill them himself. But soon, some humans, another kin would come and they would kill  the Apokryphs, all of them.  
One Apokryph asked why he would tell them this if he wanted their blood. Azrakal explained that he wanted more blood than just the dead Apokryphs could provide. So he wanted them to fight the humans, blood should be shed on both sides.

Many Apokryphs was worried by this, they started to prepare some kind of weapons. After all, the skinless god sure looked like he wanted blood, and he would want to maximize the blood he could gain.

Then, Azrakal went back to the humans, many was afraid of him but he found one human who had great dreams.  
He was named **Ras**.  
Azrakal told Ras there is power in blood, that is why he desired is so much. That if he did something great, that power would be unlocked if he changed the world, and brought his people up from the dust and dirt of their lives.  
Ras was interested.

Azrakal told him that a people far away from here, named the Apokryphs was preparing for war, to conquer and take all the humans, they would make a good excuse for him to take control, to rule and guide his people.

Ras set out with a few companions.

While Ras was on his way, Azrakal let his blood drip on to the ground, and said these words:  
"Let the blood have all the power that is, let it mark great mortals and shackle weak ones.

Created: Turn 2

Description: Blood have power. Great mortals are thus, more powerful, kings, heroes, nobility, great warriors and such are more powerful than others, such as more common people like farmers and laborers.  
Said power is not just pure physical strength, but as well mystical power. People with Kings blood is better kings than a other people.  
As blood is power, one can attempt to gain some power by using the blood, be it drinking it, covering yourself in it or soaking weapons or items in it. That is however, not permanent.

Ras did find the Apokryphs, gathering and making weapons, some of them were even training. Ras companions were worried, they must get back but Ras saw a moment to have glory, he ran out and attacked several Apokryphs. Fighting fiercely, killing some of them who returned as Unliving. Ras got covered in blood and felt a rush of power, making himself fight even more. But at last, the Apokryphs got organized and Ras had to make his escape.

He and his companions hurried back.

After their return, they talked about Ras strength, attacking those that would attack them first, getting first blood.  
Ras then took control over a small militia, saying how he would take control and take the battle to the Apokryphs. The people cheered him on.
Ras could feel power

[**Legends of the heroes activated! Ras, the Warrior King!**]

---

Ras gathered his army and ventured to the Apokryphs, there he waged war, he could feel himself growing stronger and stronger, his people looked on him as a great leader, a warrior without match and Ras liked it.

Many died and Ras returned home, his men carrying him as the victor.

Ras need for strength and glory, his desire to rule did not end there.

He talked more to Azrakal, who told him the blood was the source of his power, and he need more for it to stay. Ras asked how he could obtain such a thing. And Arakal told him things, how to crush a man's head so no unliving was born and blood poured. How to build mighty towers and shrines, palaces and temples. How to capture slaves for blood letting.

Ras got to work...

#Birth of a Empire

Ras became it's first King, he had grown taller and more powerful than any other human and he imposes his will on them. Most came willingly to his side, he was a hero after all.

He lead great raids towards the Apokryphs, capturing them and in rituals for all to see, he showered in their blood, declaring their strength now to be theirs.  
Soon, Azrakal's name was mention during these rituals.

The empire was called **Ras'shalas** after their king.  
The Empire soon used things far beyond what they should know, bronze weapons, great farming fields with irrigation, it's scholars tracked the stars and wrote down knowledge on parchment rolls. Great temples, a greater palace, cities of stones.

The Apokryphs started to fear the raids, they would come, sometimes during the night, sometimes during the day, capture people and drag them back. They had heard what happens to them, how Azrakal's name was said during the rituals.  

The rituals expanded, soon, torture became common, Sarash name, the Lady of Pain was summoned and she was delighted by the pain.

Ras'shalas grew fat and mighty on the blood of Apokryphs.  
Sometimes, some humans started to dislike what was happening. They soon ended up at the worst of the worst tortures.  
Of course, other human tribes were soon not safe from the raids of Ras'Shalas. It was a choice, Serve Ras or sacrifice.

Ras himself got many wives so spread his powerful bloodline.
