The Sorcerer had the divine soul of the Recorder lieing around in the Rift. Already humans had started to die and he had to tell the Apokryph to go and collect souls. He sighed. He had so much more important things to do. And that was when he had remembered the Recorder. Instead of the world's history, he would record death.

The Sorcerer placed the divine essence on top of the highest tower of Oneiros. Then he began sculpting. The essence became a tall figure. Almost human. It just had hundreds of eyes all over its head. The Sorcerer called it Panoptes, the all-eyed or allseer. Panoptes would look out into the Rift and the world and keep track of mortal lives and lifespans. He would record the deeds of the living and steer them towards and afterlife in the Endless Woods or Oneiros depending on their deeds. And he would dispatch the Apokryph living in Oneiros to collect the souls of the living back to the Rift.

With that job succesfully delegated he returned to do more important things.
