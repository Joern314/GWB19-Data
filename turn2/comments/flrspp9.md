The Minor God of Exotericism simply stopped when he reached the material plane, watching, and thinking. It was night and the screams started. It was day and the sun's red spot looked upon the world. The tooth-shaped moon moved across the sky.

The seasons changed, covering him with snow, water, grass and sand.

The minor god of Exotericism moved, seeking out mortals, talking, gathering information.

Years passed, but that was not a problem, not to the immortal gods.

He began to talk to other minor gods, questioning which god made what kind of creations. He even talked to gods, learning about the concept of spheres, of divine power.

He hitched a hike to the Gargantuan Snake, but she ignored him.

He listened to reenactements of Malaphet's speech.

He learned to dance, imitating anything and anyone he met to understand how they worked.

And one day, he returned home, carrying himself with sunken shoulders, quivering and stressed.

He summed up his discoveries in brief words, for he knew the Sorcerer had limited patience when directly confronted.

"The power is immediately absorbed and used to create new Minor Gods. I could prove this through lengthy statistics, if you want.

I also discovered a loophole in the laws of reality. Telling you about it would activate it. Please destroy me after this conversation. There is no need to act quickly, it will take time for anyone else to figure this out. Might become near impossible in the far future."

He went silent and stared at his creator, waiting.
