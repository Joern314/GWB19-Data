Mortals had now existed for a time, and their influence had begun to shape the world. Small influence, it must be said, but none the less an influence.

Along with Mortals came their connections. Friends, family, favorite places, favorite things.

As always follows, time came after. Friends grew distant, family passed, people don't have the time to go everywhere you want to, they lose or replace their things. All the love and emotion that they had for those things are left with no where to go. With no where to go, they simply reach The End Of The Line. 

Heaps and piles grew at the end, things so full of sentiment. Books, scrolls, and pages of memories that had passed out of heads, never to be fondly remembered or spoken of from one friend to the next. The End Of The Line grows more filled with time, a living breathing scrapyard where forgotten items and lost things may plot and plan on how they may be remembered yet, how they can return to their owners. It is the home of The Forgotten.

The first of the forgotten was a dreadfully sad little thing. A child's doll, made of clay and lovingly (Though poorly) painted with berries and other natural pigments. She had been named Dogu by her owner before she had been lost, and was the first to reach The End Of The Line. She was first to figure out why they all arrived at the End, and the first to help organize so that no one would be lost further. In time Dogu knew that her child was gone and she would never be found. Perhaps though, she could help others to not be lost.

Dogu helps guide cleaning. Things have their place, and children who care very much about their things make sure they're put away right, their toys tucked into bed, or how an adult knows to polish and care for their tools. It's said it is Dogu who whispers the idea, the gentle reminder that they have one last thing they need to do before they're done with their task.

###The End of The Line

The End of The Line is a universal scrap heap. Things that are no longer cared for or remembered end up in it's great piles, and anything forgotten from someone's memory becomes a visual record, like a tablet holding the memory as an experience to those who read it. Things that end up here have a life of their own, the personality and ability of which is determined by what they are and how much they meant to someone in their "life". These items do not literally come here, but the emotion and spirit of them do. They all strive to be reunited with their original owners who they care very much for, though after a certain point this of course may not be possible, and if they are found the connection would not be alive again since the new owner would know nothing of the item.

The things that reside in The End Of The Line are refereed to as Lostlings.]
