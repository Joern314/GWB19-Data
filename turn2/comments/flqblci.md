Azrakal was not very amused.  
He walked up to the first minor god (the one with the sponge), placed his head right next to his. His blood slowly dripping of on to the minor god as their cheek touched.

"You got 3 seconds to explain what you are doing with my *power* before I strangle you until your head pops off so I can drink your blood with ease."

Then he pulled out his dagger and pointed it at the other minor god.

"And you got half a second before I just drink you like a cup of wine."
