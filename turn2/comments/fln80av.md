##The beater of the drum and the giver of rain 

As kain was leisurely floting above the world on a storm cloud half asleep, as he  throwing lightning every so often for fun  when suddenly the most annoying sound could be heard for someone trying to sleep... the beating of drums with in the sky fallowed by the normal thunder that lightning caused 

So he stood up rubbed his temples and then began looking around the cloud about three miles away was some sort of divine In storm grey attire that resembled a dress along with short curly yellow hair who was sitting cross legged around a drum. She seemed to be holding waiting for kain to create more lightning 

“**WELL WONT YA COME ON NOW? THORW THE DAMND THING WILL YA** .” She yelled ! her voice as loud her blasted drum 


“And who might you be.” Kain asked he was clearly annoyed he didn’t sign up for little leeches 

The minor god picked up her drum  awkwardly and began hobbling over “ **IM TONDRA THE ONE WHO BEATS THE DRUM TO MAKE THE THUNDER.** “ tondra said proudly but still looking a bit like a lost puppy waiting for lightning and then a natural bolt occurred and she hit her drum much to kains dread 

“Hello I’m kain god of storms, First off inside voices, I’m right next to you know need for yelling ! Secondly... sense when does thunder get it’s own representation... storms are my domain.” Kain said crossing his arms 

Tondra gave kain a look of amusement “ **WHAT DO YOU MEAN IM YELLING! THIS IS HOW I ALWAYS TALK... AS FOR YOUR QUESTION I DONT KNOW SIR I JUST BEAT THE DRUM** ” She said beckoning to kain to make more lightning 

“ seven frozen hells ! This world is to strange...” kain said placing both hands on his face “don’t tell me there is more of you “

Tondra smiled “ **THERE IS SIR ..... REVA.... COME HERE WILL YA. SHES UNDER THE CLOUD MR KAIN.** “ tondra said with a grin 


Reva soon appeared from beneath the cloud. She was wear a grey and blue dress she seemed to be carrying some sort of large wineskin which kain could only assume made rain 

“Why hello there I’m reva the giver of rain... if this is all I’d like to get back to the rain.” She said looking annoyed she was taken away from her task 

“So how do you make the rain?” Kain asked at this point he was unsure how to react 

“Oh that simple i seed the clouds with this special wineskin, which cause  condensation to build and the rain to eventually fall” she explains 

Kain defeat decided just to roll with the two new comers and asked tondra to try and keep the sound of the drumming down but said the thunder she was making was fine
