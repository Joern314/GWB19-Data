Stirred awake by the screams Rictus roused from his slumber. He just thought to himself "What in the Shadows all fucking name is going on here!". Looking over the world he astonished registered the humans scampering about and the world being finished.

He smelled the influence of another god in the humans. Someone had finished them and ruined his plans. Irate he tracked the smell to Azrakal. Who as it turned out was at the moment in the process of being flayed.

Being still angry with the interloper he was very slow to interven.

"You are doing a bad job at skinning this duplicitious little wretch. As he deserves to suffer I wish you much joy and bid you to continue. But should you ever wish to learn how to do it properly let me know. I am Rictus, god of the hunt, I think I could teach you a thing or two!"
