With the missing power of worship, and out of genuine curiosity, and partially because she hated being told what to do, Lyva flew back out into space to look over the gargantuan serpent once more. 

"I brought you a snack in case you were hungry," She explained, depositing a leg from a water wolf into the bleakness of space, and poking it towards the serpents maw. "We're making life down there, mortals and everything, I don't think we're going to starve ever."    

Then she began to look around in godsight, trying to sense any flow of energy, what the serpent was sustaining herself or feeding the egg with, and if she herself was gaining any worship as mortals could see her.
