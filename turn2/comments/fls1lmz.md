Sarah wasn't about to give up. Her hair rose up in a black stream of power, and the cracks in the shield closed in a black...Well, not glow. Glow implied light, after all. No, it was more like black water, rolling over the cracks and leaving a smooth shield behind. Sarah growled. This wasn't enough. It wasn't enough!

she divided herself more, this time seeking to defend the cultists who cried for protection from those who once were their partners. 

Cultist after cultist, Sarah defeated all who stood in her path, cold, terrible wrath on her face like a mask. Those who were to be sacrificed she wove a divine wall around, both as protection for them and protection from them. She will decide what to do with them later. Right now, she needed to purify this place.

The Sarahs who were in town managed to calm the people and started to lead them away. When the shield cracked the people began panicking again, but Sarah managed to calm them and encouraged them to go as fast as they could. They listened to her, thankfully, and under the cover of her divine darkness begun sneaking away from the city right under the nose of the few cultists who weren't defeated by Sarah beforehand.
 
As parts of Malaphet's being neared the town, Sarah stood before him, looking as regal as a queen and as cold and absolute as an Ice Age. the massage was clear: he will not pass. Not without a terrible fight.
