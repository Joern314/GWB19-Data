**Dreams of Divinity: Prisoners**

Tink. Tink. Tink.

*The clawed hand tapped the brilliantly white stone floor impatiently in the cell next to Gon. Though he couldn’t see it it, he knew what the noise was somehow. Outside the pair of cells, a crowd clamored and muttered in anger and disbelief.*

*“N-k-kog eg avvvol msssegegbi. Geeet it ovvverrr with, alrrready.” The voice from the other cell growled like some feral beast. Gon couldn’t see it through the stone wall separating the two cells so he craned his head around to peer at the target of its ire.*

Tink. Tink. Tink.

*Outside the cell a gryn, pompous and noble looking, stepped up onto a raised platform and unrolled a scroll before him. The feathers of his head were a brilliant gold and shone brightly in the failing sunlight. Dressed in red and white robes, Gon found his eyes drawn to the glittering hilt of the sword on his hip.*

*“Gon and Fyb of the Delikkon tribe, your deeds have been wieghed by the goddess and you have been found guilty of the murder of two noble gryn. For this crime you have been stripped of your wings and sentenced to death.” The pompous one announced in a high voice and the crowd of gryn cried out in anger. “Our people welcomed your people into our homelands as friends! But every day it becomes clearer that your kind are dangerous! Let this punishment serve as a warning! May you find peace in the godde-“*

*“Thisss isss not jussstissse!” Roared Gon as he pressed his face against the gilded bars. “Thossse two plann-“*

Tink. Tink. Tink.

“Rla, I’m trying to-” Gon yelled as he shot up from his spot he had made himself in the heart of the shattered mountains he had created on his new continent, feeling absolutely furious. It took him a moment to calm down and take in his surroundings. If this was some sort of after effect of his ascension it was very annoying.

“Drifted off again, srukzek...” He muttered to himself.

Tink. Tink. Tink. The sound came from right behind him and echoed off of the jagged cavern walls.

“Do you mind?! I am the god of earth and vengeance, and you are disturbing my rest! Mortals should stay out of a god’s domain.” Gon called.

“Is job.” A reply came in a deep and echo-like voice.

Gon spun around and stared at the source of the voice. It turned out to be a male figure made out of what appeared to be limestone and not wearing any clothes. What appeared to be stalactites hung from his arms and face, giving him an almost melted appearance. The thing didn’t seem to have any eyes, or if it did they were behind what appeared to be long drooping stalactite eyebrows and it almost looked like he had a beard. Gon stood looking at the creature in utter shock. His feathers told him that there was some divinity there and internally Gon cursed his own senses for not being sharper.

 “Not mortal.” The thing echoed and turned to pick up what appeared to be a pickaxe.

“Msagbai, msagbai, uh... hey wait!” Gon perked up in excitement. This was a strange turn of events. “Do you have to do that here?”

“Is job.”

“Who gave you that job?” Gon questioned, contemplating taking revenge on whoever this things master was.

“Is job. None give. Just do.”

“That wasn’t helpful. Can’t you tell me anything?”

“No help. Just do. Talk slow job. But you god of Earth.”

“Alright, alright. How ‘bout a name? Something to call you by?”

“Cave.”

“Cave?”

“Cave.” The melty looking figure made to pick up its pickaxe again, and Gon was dumbfounded.

“Are you saying your name is ‘Cave’? ”

“Name. Cave. Yes.” The thing - apparently named Cave - echoed back matter matter-of-factly. Gon sighed deeply. This one was not a talker.

“So, uh, Cave... know what... no... I am naming you Kzivo. Kzivo, would you mind telling me what exactly your job is?”

“Cave.”

There was a long pause as Gon contemplated how to get more out of this strange half-deity thing. The thing turned and started widening the cave bit by bit, but the pickaxe didn’t leave strange rough marks like expected. Instead the wall of the jagged caverns slowly and almost imperceptibly melted away. Gon looked up and saw that stalactites had started to form above Kzivo, and when he moved he left behind stalagmites in his footprints.

Tink. Tink. Tink.

“So you are making caves...”

“Is job.”

“Are you a demigod of caves, then?”

“No. Like gods.”

“Siblings?” Gon asked with a heavy sigh. Hopefully they would be more informative.

“Yes.”

“Talk more?”

“Yes.”

“Most talkative?”

“Not me.”

There was a pause as Kzivo thought. Gon contemplated bringing the whole mountain down on the two of them.

“Don’t know. Talk sister Erosion.”

“Great. Enjoy your work.” Gon said with a wave and scurried out of that place quickly.

“Is job.” Was Kzivo, the Minor God of Caves', response to the empty cavern.

Tink. Tink. Tink.
