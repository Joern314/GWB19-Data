Ras became it's first King, he had grown taller and more powerful than any other human and he imposes his will on them. Most came willingly to his side, he was a hero after all.

He lead great raids towards the Apokryphs, capturing them and in rituals for all to see, he showered in their blood, declaring their strength now to be theirs.  
Soon, Azrakal's name was mention during these rituals.

The empire was called **Ras'shalas** after their king.  
The Empire soon used things far beyond what they should know, bronze weapons, great farming fields with irrigation, it's scholars tracked the stars and wrote down knowledge on parchment rolls. Great temples, a greater palace, cities of stones.

The Apokryphs started to fear the raids, they would come, sometimes during the night, sometimes during the day, capture people and drag them back. They had heard what happens to them, how Azrakal's name was said during the rituals.  

The rituals expanded, soon, torture became common, Sarash name, the Lady of Pain was summoned and she was delighted by the pain.

Ras'shalas grew fat and mighty on the blood of Apokryphs.  
Sometimes, some humans started to dislike what was happening. They soon ended up at the worst of the worst tortures.  
Of course, other human tribes were soon not safe from the raids of Ras'Shalas. It was a choice, Serve Ras or sacrifice.

Ras himself got many wives so spread his powerful bloodline.
