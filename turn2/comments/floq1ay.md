The snake turned her head and looked at Lyva: **"Terribly hungry. But must not eat. Big mistake. Egg gone. Could be."**

She hissed. **"Non-Egg food... Mortals... Good. Not-me eats now, then Not-me won't eat egg. Then I lay egg. Then I leave."**

She moved back into her old position. **"I wait now. Either Not-Me starves. Or Not-Me makes other Eggs. Or Not-Me eats plenty food. Always I lay egg. Always I leave."**

Lyva could not spot any flow of energy (besides the mundane heat of the sun) towards the serpent. Nothing tickled her greed, except maybe the metal veins in the not-yet-laid "egg". Which still looked just like a planet. 

In fact, the snake seemed to simply laze around, moving little to nothing at all, spending no divine powers either.

Lyva was also dimly aware that a handful mortals desired to own the ring of the sun, but that hardly counted as worship.
