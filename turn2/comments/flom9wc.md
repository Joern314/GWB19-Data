There were still many Gods who had stumbled into her universe that had yet to meet Lyva's full attention and so she set out in search of them.       
She plugged her ears and wandered the night dressed in armour, seeking the supposed patron of Protection.       
She sensed something of competition, and so donned half a dozen medals and went searching for the source of that power in fields of wheat.        
The presence of the Sphere of War was a concern to her, from experience such deities seemed wrecklessly wasteful, but she forged herself a sword and followed it like a divining rod, searching for where the sphere of war dwelt.
