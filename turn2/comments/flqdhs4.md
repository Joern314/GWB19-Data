Having kept an eye on all the gods with mortal followers to ascertain how and if they dealt with the absence of divine power income or what they would find when they investigated, the Sorcerer saw as Azrakal bashed a minor god's head in with its own bucket. Listening in from afar he knew now what to look for.

He went to the highest tower of Oneiros where Panoptes, the All-Seeing stood. Tasked with recording the death and lifespans of mortals and to observe them from afar he was the ideal pawn to help the Sorcerer find the culprit.

Panoptes peered out into the world and the Rift. Looking for any minor god coming in contact with the mortal Apokryphys on the material plane and in the Rift, who shouldn't be there by the Sorcerer's design.
