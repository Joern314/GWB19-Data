# The Witch-Queen and the Flayed One

Oryllia was sociable enough to have met nearly every other god around. Except for a couple. Until there was word of a minor goddess of pain. Something that her Hexes benefitted from.

A blazing purple light of flames appeared before Sarash and Azrakal. "Greetings, Flayed One. I am Oryllia, the Witch-Queen. I see a great future with us, the blood and pain along with the curses and profanities of creation."
