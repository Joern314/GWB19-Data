[This turn contacting mortals is still free, starting next turn it costs. You write how your god appears to some mortals. You can have them wander off to form your own tribe or if you made a deal with someone to be in their pantheon you appear to their mortals, prophet whatever. You tell them some stuff and then you describe how they worship you/ what religion formed around your contact with the mortals.]
