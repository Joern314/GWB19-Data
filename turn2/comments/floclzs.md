# Minor God: Berimbau: Lord of Rhythm

Yashqal watched for generations, the terrible horrors of the Ras'shalas Empire. Blood begat blood, as the power of the Empire grew. More men and women were taken as blood slaves to pay the tribute for the spells of the mages. Yashqal observed how the fidelity of countless innocents was extinguished, without ever expressing itself. If this wasn't wrong what was?

In their shoddy barracks or in a chain gang on a war march, the blood slaves had little time away from the eyes of the masters. But in these dark hours of the night they devoted themselves to music. From branches, dried fruits, and twine they made the instruments. Their instruments hummed and buzzed and every night the blood slaves danced a hopeful dance across the Ras'shalas empire. So Berimbau was born of sorrow and dance.

Yashqal was gliding in the woods one day when he saw a man crying. As he approached he saw this man's chest was a swirling green and yellow, covered in orange warts. Yashqal reached out with his most tender limb and touched him.

"What's wrong?" As Yashqal touched his chest he found it was dry and rough.

"My people are in so much pain."

"Who are you?"

"I am Berimbau," he thumped his chest, and it made a hollow *chak* shound.

"Do that again!"

Berimbau thumped his chest, perfectly in time, making a *chak-chak* sound for hours that reminded Yashqal of the foundations of the universe itself.

"I see now, you are rhythm, born of these people's dance. Be calm my son."

Berimbau sobbed, "give my people hope."

"I promise."

\[ /u/Plintstorm I'm going to use this as the foundation for a slave revolt in the Ras'shalas Empire that contributes to the downfall.\]
