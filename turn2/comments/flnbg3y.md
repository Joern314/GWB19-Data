"We can do either I suppose!"

Out of thin air his bow and arrows materialized.

"The first thing to keep in mind in this very strange world is the nature of its magic I suppose. Everything you hunt will eventually incinerate I suppose. If you do wish to hunt without incinerating your prey you will need to keep in that in mind."

Rictus drew one of the arrows in his quiver and plunged it into the dead animal. He surmised it had not incinerated yet as it was stored within the goddess.

"Our resident god of magic has a weird taste I guess. My arrows are made to absorb the magic coming off the dead animals and the Unliving. Although their production is a secret I will keep to myself for now. But feel free to replicate them if you wish in time. Now you can use my arrow to hunt another target and I will use one dead animal to show you how to skin them properly and you can use the other one to practice. How does that sound?"
