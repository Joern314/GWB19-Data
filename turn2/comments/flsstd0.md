"Showing a god of vengeance... mercy? *That* is an amusing thought! I would kill me if I were you in that situation, Prismari. Then there would be less competition for Lyva's affection!" Gon explained in what could have been a half-sarcastic tone. Was this really the Prismari that fought alongside his "father" during the slave wars?

"I always pictured all of Lyva's... possessions to be more, uh, *practical* than that." Gon chuckled as he straightened up. "Did you happen to spend too much time with my mother? Maybe some of her *mercy* rubbed off on you!"

"In the end, it is your choice." Gon reasoned with an odd smile. "I suppose... I... uh, *appreciate* the sentiment, at least."
