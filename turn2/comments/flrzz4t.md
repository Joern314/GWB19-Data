Upon hearing the cries of agony and pain, Thool could no longer bear it. "These mortals deserve better. The cultists are a stain on this plain that can no longer be tolerated. Burning down an entire forest, and for what? I have failed to protect the trees, but this will not happen again" Thool thought.

"If it is blood they want, it is blood they shall have". Thool appeared to the leader of the newly created living trees on the edge of the forests. "My name is Thool. With the helo of the god Yaqshal, we have given you life. What will you call yourselves?"

"We are the creation of Yashqal and Thool, so we are the Yashool. We will protect the woodlands for the rest of our days and honor the gift of fidelity" the biggest of the trees responded. 

"The Cult of Malaphet has set fire to a forest without any regard for the life it contains. They must be stopped at once" Thool declared.
