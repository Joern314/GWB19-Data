#Prompt: Minor Gods

After Azrakal was flayed, his blood spilled over the ground, his flesh burning with pain. He sat on all fours on the ground. Attempting to recover from this pain.   
All that pain caused a fellow divine being to show herself.

She bowed before Azrakal.

"I am Sarash, Minor Goddess of Pain. I was brought here when the first mortal experience just a hint of pain, but you. Your pain overshadowed all, is still does.  
Your skin, burning, your eyes like acid.  
She walked up toward Azrakal and kissed him on his forehead.  
"Your pain is quite desirable. Please, take me along your life.  
The pain mortals feel was so extreme, but now, I can barely focus on them, your pain is just so exquisite. The mortals can handle less pain for now."

Azrakal slowly rose to his feet and gazed on the minor goddess.  
He nodded towards her.  
"Then first, we shall bring some more pain."

Sarash was overjoyed and followed Azrakal. Soon, [someone else would appear](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flnib5u/)
