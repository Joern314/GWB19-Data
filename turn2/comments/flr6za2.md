Obscuring Malaphet's vision mattered little at this point, even if he hadn't already locked onto the immense magical signature of the ritual that had drawn him here, the city was aglow in the terrified little minds of the mortals and to Malaphet those to called to him as well, like a giant horrific moth to a lamp in the darkness.

The divine darkness proved much more effective against the mad cultists, who became disheartened at failing to finding more mortals to drag to the Colosseum to be used as additional sacrifices. Between Sarah's darkness and Prismari's more direct interference they were forced to return with only a handful of hapless mortals. The evacuation of mortals was a slow process due to how panicked they were and how ineffective the evacuation guidelines in place were, but at the least they were unhindered by the cultists

The hurricane of blades however, proved to be moderately more effective, as shown by it actually catching Malaphet's attention. As the main bulk of Malaphets form continued it's descent toward the city, a second portion descended from the sky, swirling around the central portion, taking blows from the hurricane of weapon, primarily protecting those places where the eyes gathered that had still not reascended before pivoting to look down upon Kain.

As Kain watched the second massive tendril following his movements he noticed a great maw opening at the end of it, and from deep within an immense glow forming from high up in the stars that raced down Malaphet's flank into the tendril that pulsed and writhed before expelling a beam of energy that moved as fast as light and turned the air surrounding it into plasma directly at him, of course he could dodge, as a god lightspeed was difficult matter but nonetheless likely still doable, especially for a god as experienced as he was, but if he did that then at it's current angle the beam would impact the city.

Meanwhile the main body, buffeted by winds and hail like swords reached the lightning wall, frying much of his outer layer, a unearthly shriek emitted from the beast, but still his form carried on downward, his sheer mass alone dragging him through the barrier, likely the gods would need something more solid then lightning if they wished to stop the behemoth from reaching his goal.

Meanwhile the cultists within the Colosseum were unphased by the darkness, they had planned for something similar, and began to bring out the next wave of slaves, this time their aim was to amplify the power of their god as he fought against the divine influences that sought to deny him his prize
