"I was a mortal man once. In my homeworld a god tried to help mortals to ascend to godhood themselves and taught them how god experience morality and how a mortal mind can influence the world in a similar way. I was mortally wounded in a hunting accident and when I thought about the lessons the monks of this god had taught me I ascended. In my village I had been among the council of elders, who made the laws there. And I had been a hunter all my life. So the law and hunting were two things I understood very well and so I thought about these things like the monks had trained people to do during my ascension. And that is how I became god of the law and hunt."

Rictus explained.

"Gods or mortals! It doesn't matter! Everyone should strife to uphold the law. If you want to learn more about my laws I can lend you my Iron Codex and you can read some of them for yourself. But be warned study of the law isn't easy!"
