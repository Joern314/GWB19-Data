"Trust is earned not given freely. No one here has done enough to earn even a modicum thereof yet. I am protector of my people. Protecting the world as a whole never works. So I protect that which is under my patronage and that shall suffice for me. And no not all mortal are the same. Not even all Apokryph deserve defending. Look at this world! At the empire Azrakal wrought! Do you think these blind fools merit the risk of losing power and making mine vulnerable in the process. Never! I am done with being the defender of those undeserving!"

The Sorcerer mused for a moment.

"Dark and full of the dead and their dreams."
