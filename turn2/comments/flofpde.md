The snake had a mostly empty stomach, only containing a few fragments of devoured souls and puddles of molten magma. She did also contain a large egg, half the size of the sole planet of this system. It was made from solid stone, and contained no further divine energy than the ambient energy of the snake. In fact, it was indistinguishable from an ordinary rock planet.

The snake hissed: **"I doubt you can protect egg from hungry Not-Mes. But diversion might work, hiding egg among foreign eggs. Your big Fake-Egg is quite good, Fake-Egg around it. Less so. Maybe make more Fake-Eggs? Or just make real Eggs. Round. Big. Like Egg."**
