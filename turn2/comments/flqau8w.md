#Crisis: Worship of the Divine (continued)

Azrakal would notice if divine power was to funnel in to him, but nothing happens?  
This require some investigation.

Azrakal would observe the people in the city, where their worship is strong to see if a hint of divine *power* would go, or if it was even there.  
He also observed slaves to cursed his name, praises and curses both leads to divine *power* after all.

[/u/joern314, I assume my idea of overflowing with worship/hate ain't working so I try using my sphere to see if I can track where the divine energy is going or if it even exist to begin with.  
I need to spend acts on that? Because I can do that, I got a few left over.]
