#Fall of an Empire

Times goes back, kings fall and new ones born.  
Seasons shift and all things comes to and end, even the [Great **Ras'shalas** Empire.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flnix1j/)

The Current King, Ragor the Third, looked out from his palace, his ancestor made this empire and it's traditions, he saw no reason to change it, but he wondered what waited on this day.

[For the gods who want to end the horrible empire of great slaughter and pain. Feel free to contribute to it here.  
Maybe cause famines, natural disasters, just straight up ball of fire on their capital, who knows?  
In the end however, nothing will remains but dead ruins.]
