Sarah returned the shield without a moment hesitation. "Of course. Then, you suggest that I Forge divine artifacts for myself, instead of simply finding them elsewhere, correct? The thing is, I don't know what kind of weapon will fit me aside form the spear and shield you have shown me. Which one do you think will fit for one on one combat?" Sarah said, thinking herself. Scythe, knife, bow and arrow? Or maybe... Is there some kind of weapon that goes along well with a shield? It could help her switch quickly between group fighting and one on one fighting if she would have to.
