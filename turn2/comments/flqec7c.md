The power was used up. Azrakal couldn't see who was using the power, maybe because his spheres weren't right for that.

The Minor God promised to not put the power into the bucket again, instead giving it directly to Azrakal.
Even if he was only a single minor god, he would devote all his time to serving Azrakal.

As the god carried around Sponge-Man, indeed divine power started flowing into him. But this was slow, the Sponge-Man wasn't fast, and a lot of power was spilled, seeping into reality in some different way than via the bucket.

However much Azrakal tormented his slave, however vast his empire was, he felt only mildly strengthened, owning only a fraction of the power that was rightfully his.

[unlocked: Solution 1 to the crisis: just gather the worship directly. I will assume that players choose the best solution/combination they know of.]
