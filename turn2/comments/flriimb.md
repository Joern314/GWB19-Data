Sarah's mind and mood were dark, and not in the pun-making sense. Her efforts were hindering Malaphet, but it wasn't enough. She looked through her darkness and saw where the main source of trouble was. She summoned a copy of herself stright in the middle of the  Colosseum. Using her powers, she broke the chains of the slaves and summoned shields to defend them. Dividing herself once more, countless copies began fighting the cultists in an effort to interrupt the ritual. Outside, a divine wall engulfed the city and its innocent inhabitants, while more copies of Sarah appeared inside it, half began calming down the people and helping them run away and the other half fought the cultists who were blinded by her divine darkness.

\[Alright, newbie question time: how much\\will it cost for Sarah to create a weapon for herself? Can she do things not exactly in her sphere, like in the breaking of the chains? Technically it could count as she was protecting them, but I still want to know just in case. Also, sorry about the copy spam. If someone needs me to change anything just say so.\]
