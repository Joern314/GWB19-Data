Sarah smiled at Lyva's antics. She was really good at being a friend, Sarah thought.  As Lyva spoke, Sarah began to think. What kind of a fighter she even wanted to be? Not one that was fearsome, at least on the outside. If anyone would laugh at her because she didn't look fearsome, he would that ability once he tasted her blade. But what about a weapon? Hmm. "Thank you." she said and took the shield tentatively. It was dark and large, the color really going well with her hair and the black gemstones. "How is this shield meant to be used?" she asked. She liked the color, but had to consider all of the shield's aspects before even thinking about acquiring something similar to herself. Lyva's suggestion seemed to fit her, but still, Sarah found a problem with the limits her suggestion implied. 
"I understand what you say," she began, thinking about her words. "and I do believe it will benefit me and the mortals to learn how fight with spears, but I think a second weapon would also be necessary. As the goddess of protection, I am bound to make enemies of other gods and beings who would seek to harm what I would wish to protect. Already, I have one god who tried to fight me and another who cursed me. I think that having a weapon that could also be of use to me in one-on-one combat would be a good choice, in addition to the spear." she finished, and looked at the metal woman "Do you have any idea what weapon could   be used for this kind of battle?"
