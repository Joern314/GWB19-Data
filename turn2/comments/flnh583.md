The Sorcerer nodded contently.

"I think we managed quite well. Feel free to visit me in the Rift."

With that the Sorcerer stood up and went to the Apokryphs.

"I am the Sorcerer. You probably remember me only as a faint dream thanks to your traversal between the Rift and the mortal world. This is Lyva, she is the goddess who helped with making these bodies for you. Honor both of us! For in this world we are your parents."

He added some more imprtant things before he walked off into the Rift.
