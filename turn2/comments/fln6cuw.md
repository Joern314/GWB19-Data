It seemed to late to try and knock him out, and Lyva wasn't entirely convinced they were unhappy screams, so she kept going with his dagger. She did move a little more hastily and carelessly as she finished, tearing the skin off entirely, though thanks to the dagger's blood absorption, she looked spotless as she finished.     

"There we are, a completed transaction." She said smoothly, summoned the manacles metal back onto her arms like necklaces, and dropped the dagger in Azrakel's mouth, "Pleasure doing business, blood god. Enjoy my scale."    

Then she vanished away, leaving Prismari to deal with the god in case he turned violent, or to make his own escape.
