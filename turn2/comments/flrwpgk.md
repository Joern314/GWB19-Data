"Uh, I have a measuring tap- oh, not physically..." Lyva blushed slightly, then considered her.    
"You don't want to be fearsome, so I wouldn't wear full platemail, it tends to be intimidating. Chainmail or scalemail can move like fabric, but can be noisy unless they're made right... perhaps a spear and shield like..." She moved to her sternum, then frowned, sighed and shrugged off her top entirely, opening a larger pair of doors running down her back. They were apparently necessary as she removed a long slender spear and a large round shield that barely rolled out of her portal, and was composed of a dark, ebony like metal that seemed to resonate with Sarah slightly.    

"Spear and shield fighting is extremely defensive, and quite effective for mortals in large groups. Each man guards the man to his left, and entrusts the man to his right with his defence while he stabs the enemy. It's a very good tactic to teach mortals to work together, but not one you can really implement in any divine fights- well, unless you're every person in the line at once!" Lyva hefted the shield and jabbed forward with the spear, her skin itself turning to the same ebony metal that seemed dimmer than it should be, even clubbing her tail out at an imaginary opponent.     

"If you'd like, you could hav..." She began to say, then paused and turned the shield slowly in her hands fondly, biting her lips, "Uh... you could examine them."
