As Gon stepped out into the blinding light of the morning sun, he let out a yawn. Were gods meant to be sleepy? Gon didn't know, but the dreams were strange. No one he had ever met spoke like that. Sure, Lyva might have picked up a few words here and there, but not like that.

"Malo..." Gon chuckled to himself with a soft smile and raised a hand to shield his eyes from the sun. "A perfect word for that one..."

A second rune wriggled, shifted, and blazed adjacent to the first on the back of his left hand. Gon stared at it for a long time. Something was definitely wrong with that. It too was familiar, but he couldn't read it. It would have to wait, he told himself. Concerned that others might know what they mean, the gryn tore off part of his robe and wrapped it around his hand to hide the runes.

He shook his head to rid himself of the thoughts. There was a task to attend to; he needed more information on these "minor gods". No such thing had existed in the last world. Knowing that Erosion would happen on the jagged peaks he ascended the mountains, slowly scanning all around. He kept a hand on his sword, just in case erosion was hostile. Before long, he came across what he was looking for.

Near the peak of mountain, a young girl, dressed in pauper's clothes with no shoes. Except that the rags looked appeared to be made of perfectly smooth shale. Her skin reminded him of Shilo's smooth statuesque features, except that it appeared to be made out of granite instead of fine marble. What should have been her her hair instead appeared to be gullies that marked where water carved its paths down the side of mountains.

The little minor goddess Erosion was scrubbing madly away at the jagged surfaces of the mountain tops and making them smoother. Gon looked on in amazement as the little thing appeared and disappeared with a great amount of energy and enthusiasm. One moment she was scrubbing away at the mountain with what looked like sandpaper, the next she was gleefully kicking rocks down a cliff to start a rock-slide, then slamming a surprisingly large hammer into boulders to create cracks before returning with a pail of water and dumping it into the cracks and breathing on it to form ice that caused the cracks to expand. 

"You know I worked very hard to make these mountains and I like their jagged look." Gon asked as he stepped onto the spot she was trying to sand smooth and the little girl looked up at him with eyes that were the color of the sky.

"Who are you? Wait... oh hello earth-god. You are interrupting my work." Erosion replied as she blinked at Gon, before disappearing and reappearing to sand down a different spot.

"These mountains will be smoothed out in no time! It is the way of things, my job! You have given me quite a lot of work so thank you! What do you want?"

"Do mind stopping for a second? I would just like to have a quick chat." Gon asked quickly, trying to keep her attention.

"I do mind! You gave me work to do, so I do it! I smooth and break into little stones until they are sand then I sweep them away. Oh! I know why you are here! you need smoothing, earth-god! And you are so big! I'll help make you smooth and small!"

"Wh-what?" 

"I break you! Alright?!" Erosion exclaimed as she appeared next to Gon with a surprisingly large hammer and swung it at him. Gon just barely managed to dodge the blow, and in doing so lost his footing and slid part way down the mountain.

"H-hold on! Tha-"

"I break you!" The little minor goddess squealed exitedly appeared with her legs almost on Gon's shoulders and delivered a headbutt to his forehead and the both tumbled down the mountain. 

"Owwww." the little one moaned. "Whyyyy did that hurt meeee?"

"Beeecause I am not just the god of Earth, but also God of Vengeance. I tried to tell you." Gon groaned as he rubbed his forehead. "It is not a good idea to hurt me. Now will you listen?"

"I... smooth, I... break... alright... What do you want?"

Gon proceeded to explain his encounter with her brother before finally asking:

"How did you come to be?"

The girl stared at him in shock. "What do you mean? You big boss gods made these things but didn't take up the job of maintaining them, who else would do them? I am grateful for purpose from you earth... vengeance god. You gave me lots of work to do! So much to break and smooth and polish! Ah! I must get back to work! Can I go now then big boss god?"

"Yes, you may, but since I am your boss I would like to give you a better name. From now on your name is... Olasea, got it?"

"Yep! Thank you big boss vengearth-god!" She bounded up and with a quick bow she vanished.

The encounter left Gon exhausted and frustrated. He decided that minor gods were likely to not even have a consistent backstory. In fact, if he were in a bet with Lyva, he would be fairly confident putting all of his money on the fact that no one really knew why they collectively existed. He would prefer not to have any more surprise visits from minor gods. Perhaps if he made a proper home in the mountains roots it would be more secure.

So Gon crept back into the caves in the shattered mountains and descended until he found a place that suited him. Throwing a minor amount of divine power into the surrounding mountain he carved out a deep temple complex, where the jewels he buried with the mountains' formation glittered from every wall, ceiling, and floor. Finely squared rooms with high ceilings, passageways, and steep stone stair cases connected the rooms and led to many exits into the maze of caves created by the cracks in the mountain above. In the center of this complex he raised a stone chair, and audience chamber to meet any more minor gods who wondered in. Behind this stone throne, a smaller room formed the complex's inner sanctum. Here Gon hoped to spend some time in peace from any other minor gods that might pop up. When his mortals were ready, he would fill this complex with them. It would be fantastic, Gon was sure. This place he named Nkan'gbamo.
