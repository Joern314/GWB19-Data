Panoptes shook his head, having seen none such minor gods before, but also having never really looked for this specific task.

Yet when he looked following the Sorcerer's command, to his surprise, there were several minor gods. Some white pigeons who tried to bring gathered power to the gods, but who were eaten by hawks, who instead spilled the power. There also was a minor god with a large mouth, who sucked the power out of sleeping mortals. The longer Panoptes looked, the more hidden figures he spotted who attended to various sub-tasks of the gathering and spilling of divine power.

The Rift was rather clean of minor gods in the beginning, but it seemed that not only did some sneak inside, but new ones appeared as well.

For example there was a minor god who switched things in mortals' homes, making it harder for them to find their stuff.
