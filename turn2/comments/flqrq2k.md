The minor gods she trapped answered her questions as best as they could... considering many were weird spirits with little intelligence and understanding, she learned not much.

Some minor gods had been born as the children of other minor gods, had hatched from animal eggs, had formed from the essence of gods mixing during chaotic fights, had grown from trees, and many other weird ways of how a minor god could come to be.

They all had some purpose: gathering, spilling, nurturing, coloring and even test-tasting of divine power produced by mortals. Some seemed to be tasked with creating confusion and chaos between the other minor gods, and one minor god of Rage  blindly attacked anything that approached her. 

One minor god was found by Lyva per accident, a weirdly grown sphere of fungal matter. Lyva's godsight told her this creature stored the "Secrets of the Universe", but there was no way to access the contained knowledge, not without the right divine spheres.
