"I am Greed, Sarah." Lyva stood, her tail lashing, teeth bared in a sharklike smile. "I want everything. I don't want something so destructive as to destroy everything, or so exhausting as to command everything, so I decided I want to own everything."    

"I forged the heart of this planet from my treasures, brought it's mantle with a trade from the stars, and its crust... well, you saw my exchange for it. I bought the skin of Power, and used it to stabilise and help the world. I built and bought all that it is made from, therefore it's mine." She explained eagerly, then noticed her confusion and knelt again to meet Sarah's eyes.      

"You're welcome to work on it. I hardly mind gods sculpting continents and forests and beauty on my world. But I'm not going to let anyone destroy it or steal it or threaten it. I think we can cooperate, don't you?"
