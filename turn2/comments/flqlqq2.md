Soon a heavily beaten Yinquel returned, telling Lyva proudly that he had subdued several minor gods who were collecting the divine energy produced by mortals. 

[+1 gain, same solution as Plint: direct collection]

Vesper confirmed that prayers were working as they should, not a single one had gone missing since her inception, offering Lyva a large chest in which she had collected every one of them.

Chantra returned with flowers, and sang a song of praise, using various words the mortals had invented just to please Lyva. She admitted that the mortals probably could worship Lyva even more, but that might only be expected of fanatics, and only having fanatics wasn't seen as praiseworthy by the non-fanatics, so it was hard to increase the total amount of praise even further. 

Igali dozed away during Chantra's talk, as if he already knew all these new words. He suggested giving Yinquel more and stronger arms. He also stated that he had made several hundred new friends when visiting other minor gods, many born from his own ideas, and that they were also looking for hints among the mortal villages, slave sheds of the Empire, and even in the emptiness of space now.

Leyana finally made some complex calculations and told Lyva that there still was not enough divine power, that some of it had to be lost on the way. Whatever project was fueled with this missing power, it was big.

Finally Igali pointed out that copying the strategy of some deity who was certain to survive this crisis might easily guarantee survival. Although,  he wasn't too sure about this, he wasn't exactly good at separating good from bad ideas.
