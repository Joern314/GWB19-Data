"Do you mean for my trees to walk the earth as if they were man? Now there is a thought indeed" the old man mused. "Perhaps this is not the best form to do this" and the old man changed into the beautiful young Spring form. Strumming the melody of spring on her lute, the trees took on a lush green and began swaying back and forth.  "Now my trees, show fidelity to man and walk this plane!" Thool declared.

"So long as the seasons shall change, your people shall walk this planet". Though you are made from wood you too shall know what it means to be mortal. The Empire knows not of compassion or emptahty, they do not live long enough to know what it means to respect the land or each other. I give you the gift of extended life.
