“Prismari god of heroes ! I can maybe protect egg! Protecting a baby is something a hero would do.... Prismari thinks 

But maybe I’ll try making a fake egg or two...... “ prismari wasn’t always the smartest god but even he with enough time can put things together 

“wait when you say fake egg do you mean the planet and the moon....” Prismari said thinking he and kain may not have the power to do that alone 

Kain on the other hand was stumped this being could very well be the cause or it could just be a scared mother trying to lay and egg he was unsure and it was begin to bug him
