###Judges and Laws

Seeing what the mortal world was like and how the world was shaped with the empire of Azrakal rising, Rictus hand was forced. He went to the humans he had at least in part created and introduced himself.

To establish himself as friendly he taught them how to make magical arrows that absorbed magical energies so they could hunt and actually eat what they killed when they hunted. He told them however not to share this knowledge.

The he took out his Codex of the Iron Law and chose from among them an elderly man who clearly served as somewhat of an adviser to the people. He taught the man the Iron Law and performed a miracle to invest him with the powers of an Iron Judge.

###Judge of People

As his next action he created a minor god this world seemed to be full of. He named him Radamanthys. He was to serve as the Judge of Judges. Deliberating on who was worthy to receive the powers of an Iron Judge and to use them responsibly. 

And upon finding such a person and establishing that their city, nation, region or even general area was in need of the protection the Iron Law afforded would be granted the powers of an Iron Judge.

###The Chains of Law

When Ras, the emperor of blood, was getting older and his people believed him to be slipping or losing his edge, he tried to establish himself as his old self, as the cruel tyrant he was known and feared as, as the monster who had served as the font for a myriad of streams of blood running down the lands of humanity.

At the head of a raid Ras traveled towards the forests of Rictus' people. And upon confrontation with the tribe of hunters his raiders found themselves confronted with people who could competently hunt, meaning they concealed themselves in the woods, peppered his troops with arrows while remaining essentially unseen and after heavy losses, when the raid finally reached a village a lone old man stood in front of the raiders.

Ras only laughed as he was challenged in authority and commanded to leave. The old man however didn't flinch. He just proclaimed the sentence according to the Iron Law. Ras found his powers inaccessible, he was unable to move and unable to speak. He was in essence imprisoned in his own body. Then the old man took a hunting knife and an arrow and began carving up Ras like a chicken.

His cronies having been sentenced to watch the execution were unable to help him.

“This is your emperor!” the old man said. “Take the pieces and go home. And tell your people that Rictus, the god of law, will not look further upon your breaking of his divine law with impunity!”
