Prismari looked surprisingly calm at the information that he and gon May have to one day fight. It wasn’t confidence nor fear it was a calm sadness 

“Prismari sees no true reason to lie to a friend... if worse come to worse we will still always be friend.” Prismari said nodding his head 

“If the day should come we must fight.... Prismari won’t ever take your life... you and lyva and I are all from the same home and those from that world that did good will always hold special place to Prismari “ Prismari said with a smile
