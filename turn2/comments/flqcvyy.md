After a while, Azrakal, after hearing his own name repeat twice pulled the sponge god out of the bucket.  
He instead put the sponge god down, very carefully, even wiping away some streaks of blood from his face. (And then promptly drank it).

"Alright, first, take your... sponge, gather some of my divine *power*, and put it in the bucket, I want to see it happen."

One could wonder if Azrakal was grinning or not, as he did not really have a face anymore to perform expressions.

"Maybe I got a new job for you, collecting my divine *power* for me.  
Or I drink you. This or that, who knows?"
