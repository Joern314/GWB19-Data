"You are an agent of change and chaos are you not, perhaps you should look past your misgivings due to your age and create what you will, Yashqal of the Dances. You must test your limits, do not worry of what others will think, only of what you can do. For this world,  admittedly younger then most I encounter is still like all others and will one day be engulfed by either stagnation or a being of the void such as myself. And when such a time comes to this world, your mistakes will not matter, only what you have learned." Malaphet's words resounded in the young gods mind in perhaps an encouraging tone, though it was difficult to tell as even with the clarity of conversation that Yashqal enjoyed with the strange being, due to how purely alien Malaphet's mind was to most other forms of thought.
