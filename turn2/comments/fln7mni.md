"The answers to these questions are quite easy and no secret. So allow me to enlighten you."

The Sorcerer said conjuring up two chairs and a table with tea from the Sleeping City. The one useful thing he had learned in the Illuminated Land was that a gesture of common courtesy didn't hurt and was often appreciated, Mina had shown as much.

"May I offer you a cup of tea? Or something else more to your liking?"

He sat down and indicated the other chair.

"I am not offering a gift but a trade of sorts. I brought along on my journey to this world the mortal race I was created and ascended from by another god. We left our homeworld to look for one safer or better at least and on the way I am keeping my eyes out for the god who made my people and helped me along the way to godhood. That is why I am here. As for the trade I offer. The young among my people have never seen a life outside the Rift. They wish to see this new world and live in it. I could strain my own powers to their limits and adapt bodies that can safely breath this air, walk this world and fight of the sicknesses that inevitably exist here. But that would be tiresome. Instead I offer to form a pantheon. I will pay half their way into this world and you the other. And in turn we shall form their pantheon."
