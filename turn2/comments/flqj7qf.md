##Minor Experimentation     

The existence of minor gods fascinated and inspired Lyva. True, they could be pests like the Lizard of Paranoia, or unpleasant like Ferrick of Corrosion, but surely they didn't have to be. And so she decided to try and create her own.    

From the lingering essence of souls she had consumed, and her own greedy nature, Lyva produced a neat naga-like minor god, her scales covered in beads like an abacus. She was called **Leyana,** Minor Goddess of **Accounting**, and was given the role of maintaining and tidying Lyva's hoard inside herself.       

There was a lack of suitable combustion gods, and so Lyva lured a mortal to a volcano with promises of immortality, and threw him in. From his soul and the magma, she forged a flaming demonic figure, bound as Minor God of **Combustion**, to keep fires burning as they should, and named him **Pyraphes**.     

She gathered the remains of the Lizard from her stomach, and decided to try and remake paranoia into something more useful. So she siphoned more power of the Awakened and her own knowledge into it, and created a small glowing golden dragon. This was named **Igali** and now would focus on helping ideas be created, managing **Inspiration**.    

Igali quickly gave her another good idea, and half a dozen terrible ones, and so she lingered over a gathering of Apokyphes worshipping her. From the Hunger inside her and the sounds of prayers, songs, and praise, she forged three sisters to oversee what she considered the divine "economy", the flow of power of rightful thanks from mortals to their deities. **Vesper** was an eyeless long tailed figure covered in ears, the patron of **Prayer**. **Chantra** was a three headed figure covered in mouths who sang, and patron of **Praise**. **Yinquel** was an eight armed figure of boundless energy, and patron of actions as **Worship**.     

With the creation of them, she sent the sisters of the divine economy out to try and gather and correct whatever was clogging the system, with Igali pestering them with many possible ideas.
