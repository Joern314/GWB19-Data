Horrible creature most mortals  didn’t stand a chance then there was a Cleaver man named zephon how had been studying the demons and thought he had figured out a way to kill one... it was rather simple, yet no one was brave enough to try 


As the soldiers and demons closest in on his home, Zephon and half the village had fled from the encroaching demons in to the forest. The demons where in fast pursuit and one had caught sight of them 

Zephon knew they all where dead as this raged filled beast charged, he told the others to flee  but they where frozen with fear as he charged toward the demon as he did he could of swore he saw a a rainbow headed person giving him a thumbs up and say “grab your fragment of possibility ! Become who you need to become “ Then faded 

Soon the beats was upon him bashing his head with great strength, but still zephon survived he tried to face it with his sword, but the seam on snapped it 

The beast was ready to kill him so it grappled him to the ground about to sink it’s toothy maw into his body when he stabbed the broken blade right in its eye with all his might 

The creature grew still and zephon crushed its head to be sure
