With the intruding pain and hunger racking through his mind prismari assumes he gained a little more insight in to Malaphet mind... he wasn’t sure if he felt bad or scared for the god or him self . But he figured no one should be so hungry or be in so much pain 

“I CANT LET YOU EAT THEM!!! IM SORRY” Prismari screamed and pointed his crystal blade into the sky the electric energy that was bound to it shot upward into the sky causing  a large lightning bolt with a source energy of more than a  hundred gigajoule

As the lightning hit Prismari was trying to shrug off the foreign mind invader and shoot forward blade in hand  

As prismari’s charged he noticed the goddess of protection too fighting 

“IF WE WORK TOGETHER MAYBE WE CAN WIN!” Prismari yelled to Sarah unsure if he was heard or even seen by his fellow divine in this hectic battle
