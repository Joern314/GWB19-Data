"He... stole... one of Lyva's scales?" Gon replied to the part that mattered the most to him first and closed his eyes for a moment as a mad grin slipped onto his face.

"...And that last bit? What did you say? You two skinned him? Skinned? As in you took a*ll* of it? Do I have that right? Hehahaha! So I sssuppose Lyva doesn't need me, then... my... she is lucky that I..." Gon paused, unable to finish the statement and opened his eyes. A glimmer of what appeared to be amusement or maybe even happiness seemed to shine from them.
