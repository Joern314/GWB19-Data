Sarah was greatly disturbed by the event, but when the god cursed her name she couldn't help but snap back, "I am the goddess of protection, but you won't call on me to protect you, would you?" she wanted to turn away, but found that a sense of sympathy stopped her. She and the other god might not get along, but the least she could do was to be a witness, and if he would allow her, to help him once it was done.
