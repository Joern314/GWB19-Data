Azrakal bowed his head slightly as he took the spell.

He ventured to Ras'Shalas, there he meet with Ras, the King and presented the spell, forged by the Witch-Queen, a great god that will bring destruction on his enemies.

Ras liked that. Quite a big deal.  
Soon, the armies of Ras'Shalas moved with slaves that were cut down so the mages could perform their rituals, out from it came the demons who were sent do demoralize their enemies and cause casualties among the defenders, so the unliving could do more harm.

Stories went around Ras'Shalas of the Witch-Queen, a powerful maker of demons, and from Ras'Shalas enemies, words of the cruel demons.
