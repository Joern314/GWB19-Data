"Well then welcome to this world. I suppose I am from here. We were born from the cycle of days and we are the bringer of the seasons. To help aid me in the process my new friend over there (gesturing towards Malaphet) helped me make a moon. My desire? I suppose to plant trees and ensure their protection! I also will usher in the change of seasons, it seems to help the mortals" Thool said. "What was your old world like? And how did you get here?"
