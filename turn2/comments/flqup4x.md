Lyva hoarded the Secrets of the Universe away. It felt nostalgic to see something secretive, and perhaps she could convince Malaphet to try and decode it sometime.     

She was fascinated by the diversity of the lesser spirits, and decided they were probably the result of her entry and stirring things up. Therefore they were hers. Not that she hoarded them all away, she was just happy to claim ownership of them.

The Gatherers seemed the primary problem for now, and so she tried to follow them and trace their processes, stalking them to see where they took the gathered power.
