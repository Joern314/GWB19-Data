Time passes, and the world grows older. With it everything within as well grows too. Under Doru's guidance mortals cared for and mentained their things with extra caution, and their tools truly shined. Under such attention and care, how could sparks not fly?

As tools and toys began to love their owners, they put their backs into serving as best they could. Few are forgotten when they are useful.

The reverse is true as well though, and not all heeded their things. Some were put to constant abuse, mistreatment and neglect. It is hard to forget those which are a constant pain, and they made sure to give as well as they got. The Forgotten could not condone such actions, but they were effective.

[-15 for metaphysic: Tsukumogami, or familial bonding

Items and objects over long periods of time with one owner and a lot of attention will build a relationship. A tool treated with love and care will do it's best to help, while one mistreated will actively sabotage its owner. The items can not do a significant amount, but a knife may stay sharp longer or dull quicker, while a sword or shield may move into/out of the way just in the knick of time. Stuffed animals and dolls will play or taunt children, of course having favorites. Over time, the objects will develop personalities and the more rooted the spirit is to the item and it's owner, the more it is capable of doing on its own.]
