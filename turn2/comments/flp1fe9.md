Sarah considered asking the woman to go to a more private place, as she didn't want to appear incompetent in front of the mortals, but then dismissed the idea. Mortal life passed in an instant to a god. They would forget soon enough. "I am not sure I understand how out interactions with mortals are supposed to work." she said slowly, trying to think how to express her problem. "It is my first universe, so I really don't know how to gather followers or speak to them or make them do as I ask or anything really. So far the only things I managed to do were related to myself only, like making copies of myself and such, but I have no knowledge about things related to others."

[translation: I am slightly lost about how to start the whole worship thing and I really need a live explanation about everything because reading the rules only help me to understand the costs and methods and such, but not how to actually do things. Some things I think I understand, like if I want to create a region I simply say that Sarah created a region using her powers, but in other things I am lost. Really sorry about that.

Too Long, Didn't Read: How do I start about making mortals worship Sarah? Simply write that mortals started worshiping her and that it?]
