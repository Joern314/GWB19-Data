# Minor Gods: Miss Fortune

Oryllia had heard about these minor gods around, how they lacked guidance. And after her failed attempt with Sarah, she knew that this was her next chance at a deal.

She appeared before one, a profaned giantess who wandered across the world, her skin a deep amber color.

"And who might you be?" the giantess asked with intrigue and wariness.

"I am here to make you an offer. Come with me, and the way shall be open to you. You wander and you toil over this endless path. Well, I say no more to your aimless trek."

The giantess' face turned from pain to joy as Oryllia took her by the hand into the Hexforge. The sparkling violet form of the Witch-Queen then led the Giantess to a garden, filled with beautiful flora.

"Here, you are no longer lost. This is where the toils of the world are sewn. Help me, and here you shall call home. *Do we have a deal?*"

"We do."

# New Minor God: Rhelii the Reaper/"Miss Fortune"

Once a blighted mortal who wandered the earth in fruitless pursuits, Rhelii now serves within the Hexforge, tending to the Witch Gardens, where the resources for Oryllia's dark concoctions are made. She appears as an amber-skinned giantess with long braided and dreaded hair, colored black. She is responsible for sewing the misfortunes of mortals within the flora of the garden.
