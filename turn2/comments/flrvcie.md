"My purpose is to represent complex things in a simplified form. The gods are immortal, invulnerable, uncontrollable. But their creations are fragile and easily destroyed. 

Let's assume that the terrible secret I know is a word, that when spoken or explained, would activate a magic spell. And that spell would explode, destroying the world and leaving the gods to stand in the ashes of creation. Would you still want me to tell you the word or explain its meaning?"

[Edit: added to the death-part]

"Also, I would prefer to simply be no longer. I have learned sufficiently much about this world, my purpose is fulfilled. From now on the gods will only increase the complexity, something I am not keen on witnessing."
