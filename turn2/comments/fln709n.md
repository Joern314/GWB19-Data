It took seconds for a silvery portal to appear, and a humanoid woman with dark greenish metal skin, curling ram horns and a serpentine tail to appear before him. Lyva wore a strange grey dress that seemed to breathe slightly as if alive, and silver jewellery adorned with small glyphs and runes that might have been magic once, somewhere else.     

"Greetings, it's nice to meet you outside of your bubble, Sorcerer." She answered politely, though looked a little surprised at his appearance, less chaotic than she had expected from his metaphysics. "You seem to understand me well enough. Yes, I would like to own things, but your tone suggests this isn't going to be a gift, is it?"

"What do you want, sir Sorcerer? Not as trade, but why are you here? What is your goal?" She wondered, tail curling around herself defensively.
