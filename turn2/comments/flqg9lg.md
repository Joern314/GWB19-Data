With the great empire rising and apparently set on blood magic, Lyva changed her mind. She had set one of her favourite swords, an old creation of Prismari, in a stone to try and impress them with the potential of metal, but if they were just going to be complete savages, then she'd take it away before they found it.    

Yet when she returned to the blade, she found that the steel was weathered and brownish, rust coasting the blade, and an amber crumbling gargoyle was rubbing it intently.   

"What in the void are you? What are you doing, that's Mine!" Lyva snapped, darting forwards to rip the blade out of the ground snapping it in two in the process, "ARGH! Hey, what was that!?"     

"It was left out, exposed to the elements. It rusted." The gargoyle creature frowned, cocking its head, and began rubbing and wearing down the broken blade, "It's a natural reaction of the oxidization of metals, causing their exterior layer to-"

"I know what rust is. I'm the Goddess of Metal. And Greed. My name is Lyva." She growled, considered the blade, and hefted both pieces up to store them away. "And you?"

"Ferrick." The Gargoyle growled, stroked his brow, and vanished. Lyva growled, rolled her eyes and did the same, finding themselves at the edge of a village burnt down where a bronze spear served as a grave marker.

"You're Corrosion, aren't you." Lyva realised, "Great, just what I needed."

"Turn to Iron then I'll work on you." Ferrick mumbled single mindedly.    

"I... that was sarcasm, if you try to corrode me or anything I wear, I'll drop you in the deepest trench of the ocean." Lyva threatened casually, knelt down and looked over him. He lacked any greater sphere, he was barely more than a spirit to godsight, built on one task, and yet she wondered if he might grow more personified or intelligent as time went on and more metals to corrode pervaded society. This would bare investigation.
