Lyva went to meet them, this time platinum and grey an wielding an ornate hammer. With it, she smashed into the earth and began to call up earth and metal bound together into sculptures of horned figures, first one, then a dozen, then hundreds as were needed. As the ghostly figures emerged, they found themselves drawn into the clay and metal shells, turning them to flesh and blood that stumbled, and found themselves warm, breathing clean air. 

Lyva made sure to work slowly enough that the eldest mortals saw her at work, saw the formation of the husks and the union to create the younger ones, and all found they had horns of various sorts emerging from just above the temples of their foreheads that resembled those of the goddess. 

"Welcome to my universe, travellers of the Rift," She said warmly, and soon stopped once all were formed, looking over her creations with a nervous pride. Once she vanished from their sight, the Sorcerer could feel her almost jumping for joy at her first mortals.
