["and summoned shields to defend them" <- i was referring to that sentence, because you were asking about creating a weapon for herself. And i meant that the shields will probably corrode and break in the next few centuries. Thus they won't be there in turn 3 (where the Age of Cosmogony has ended and eons have passed). And because the current phase of the game encourages free-style roleplaying, you don't need to pay for stuff that doesn't exist in turn 3 anymore, including these shields, or Azrakel's Empire.]
