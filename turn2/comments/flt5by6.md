\[ u/smcadam I told some mortals I was your kid\]

Sunda spent time hunting, tracking, prowling. He wandered the world and found small divines, ones younger than even himself.

He promptly informed them that they worked for him.

There wasn't many, but he found a few that echoed in the same way he did. **Kra**, guardian of cubs and pups, **Tornac**, punisher of defilers, and **Yoet**, moonlight wrath, soon swore allegiance to the Lord of the Wilds.

During his hunts he came across mortals, mostly humans in the lands he was in, and informed them of who he was.

"I am Sunda, son of Lyva." The one horned god declared. "For as long as her name is known so to shall mine."
