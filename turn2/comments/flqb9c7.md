Divine power was a form of power, and Azrakal did well to investigate.

His mortals produced it just fine, especially the slaves cursing him with all the hatred they could find, but the power was absorbed, seeping away into the foundations of reality.

With a small pop, a man appeared in the slave shed, wielding a yellow sponge. He looked at Azrakal and just said "Sorry for the intrusion, I need to collect some stuff." 

Then the Minor God began wiping the mortals, who didn't have the strength to resist, wringing the divine power he collected into a bucket.

With a second pop a Minor God appeared, jumping into the straw and cutting the mortals with a tiny knife. "Must make tiny cuts! Hehehe! Cut-cut! Maybe stab some times, too!"
