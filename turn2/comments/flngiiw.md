Two skinning knives appeared on his belt.

"These are skinning knives. They are altogether better suited to skin something properly."

He held out one knife to Lyva.

"And to skin something properly it is easier to hang it upside down by its legs."

He produced a length of rope.

"Then you making an incision along the legs."

He continued to outline how to properly skin one's quarry. How to remove the blood, bone, entrails and how to carve up the meat.
