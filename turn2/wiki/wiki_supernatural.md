###Life after Death

**Creator**: The Sorcerer (/u/Gwydion-Drys) 

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgku2r/)

**Amended**: -

**Description**: In accordance with the laws of thermodynamics energy can not be created or destroyed only displaced and transformed. The energy of life permeating mortal bodies does not fade with death.

In animals the energy once keeping them alive turns into magical energy. The one and only source for everything magical. This magical energy has only a very short halflife and dissipates into the surrounding world as light and heat energy.

Once a mortal has reached the end of his/her/its natural life span or is killed in another way the soul is separated from the body. The body however does not die off. It is transformed into a so called “Unliving”.

The Unliving are feral beings not unlike zombies, but instead of rotting they are functionally alive bodies without minds beyond those of primitive animals only set on sating their base desires like food, drink and procreation.

If an Unliving is killed its animating force turns into magical energy as well. The transformation from magical energy to heat and light occurs in seconds. An Unliving explodes with the force of a grenade and the smaller the animal the less force/ magic is released.

To kill an Unliving its brain needs to be destroyed. Any parts attached to the head stay active.

Unclaimed souls and those claimed by the Sorcerer are after death escorted to the afterlife in the “Rift”, the Sorcerer's plane, by the mortals inhabiting the Rift and only those inhabiting the Rift.

The Unliving yearn to sate all their animal desires including food, sleep and sex at all costs. They are however biologically mortal and produce mortal children.

###The Thirteen Hexes

**Creator**: Oryllia(/u/DragoneyeCreations)

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flhf0w8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**Description**: A set of thirteen distinct blights upon the world, forged by the primordial dregs of creation.

####Hex 1 - The Soil Shrieks

Every time a region of the world is covered in darkness, the air is filled with bloodcurdling screams.

###Fidelity

**Creator**: Yashqal(/u/hpllamacrft)

**Created**: [Turn 1]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flhz5pr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**Description**: The true essence of all things, which can be mimicked to induce transformation. 

Every thing has a core essence. This essence can be perceived by the outward characteristics of a thing. Creatures can change their own core essence by dancing in a way that mimics the core essence of another thing. This is called showing fidelity. By showing fidelity to a thing one adopts a thing’s outward characteristics to a limited degree.
For example, a mortal looking to become tougher may show fidelity to a boulder. From observing the boulder they invent a boulder dance that captures the essence of boulders. Then the mortal practices this boulder dance for years; his skin grows tough and he is able to withstand strikes with greater resistance. In the same way, a fox dance may make someone stealthier, the gazelle dance may make someone more beautiful, the fruit dance may make someone more fertile.

###The Blood Dagger

**Creator**: Azrakal (/u/Plintstorm ) 

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgrobm/)

**Description**: A dagger forged with the scales of Lyva and the Blood of Azrakal. The Dagger absorbs blood, including that inside the people it stab.

###The Retaliator

**Creator**: ??? ( /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW ) 

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flg98lz/)

**Description**: 
A feather shaped blade that has turned to pitch black obsidian after being used in a ritual to ascend to godhood. A fuller ran the length of the blade and formed what would have been the stem of the feather. The shining brass or gold guard was formed in the shape of wings, the handle wrapped in a what had become rough blackened leather in a criss-cross fasion, and the pommel was in the shape of a bird's head with three eyes. Each eye was a different gemstone; emerald, ruby, and diamond.

The Retaliator was sword of divine creation that Gon brought along with him from another world. Having lost its old patron and having being used as a catalyst to create Gon's spark of divinity, it was been rendered powerless and immaterial.

**Blessings**: 0 (The blade exists as a part of Gon's divine form only, for now.)

###The Hexforge

**Creator**: Oryllia (/u/DragoneyeCreations)

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flhf0w8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**Description**: A large citadel made of dark stone and illuminated by violet fires, not unlike those that make the shape of its creator. From within the Hexforge, it appears to levitate over the world like a satellite.

####Notable Locations within the Hexforge:

The Dreg Pool - a small pit of primordial sludge that contains the Hexes

The Altar of the Witch-Queen - a large cathedral-like chamber with a throne atop a pedestal; acts as Oryllia's throne room

The Athenium - a library containing various tomes that hold dark arcane powers

The Witch Garden - a field of various fauna grown and harvested for crafting Hexes

###The Rift

**Creator**: The Sorcerer (/u/Gwydion-Drys) 

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgku2r/)

**Amended**: -

**Description**: The Sorcerer's very own plane between worlds. For the souls of the dead it functions as an afterlife for the Apokryph it is their home dimension. 

The Rift is a volatile, shifting and twisted mirror version of the material world. It grows and changes as the material plane does. The Rift is a place born of Magic and Death. The **Endless Woods** make up the majority of the plane. It is steeped in eternal darkness. The terrain is unreliable and distances change at will. Where an hour ago a river was flowing now a mountain could be standing.

At the center of the plane, suspended in mid air instead of a sun hovers a white city, **Oneiros**, the city of sleep.

Three kinds of dead souls are found in the Rift:

- The first are souls with no other afterlife to go to.

- The second are the faithful of the Sorcerer.

- The third are the souls of the dead Apokryph, waiting for reincarnation.

The first two kinds are judged and either allowed entrance to Oneiros, where they can sleep and dream away the time. 

If they are found unworthy they are tossed into the Endless Woods where they are forced to prey on each for eternity, while their worst nightmares take shape and torment all of them equally.

The third kind live among their living kin, but are unable to leave the Rift.

Beyond that the Rift connects to all Rift Woods of the material world. Mortals, who know how and dare to enter, will be able to go to this plane through the Rift Woods. Then they can wander the Rift until they reach a place connecting to a different patch of Rift Wood and return through there to the material plane or they find the hidden way to Oneiros, where they can try to reach their dead loved ones.

While people not privy to the secrets of mastering the Rift Woods and the Rift will be in danger of stumbling blind into this plane and never come back. Because they run afoul of the dangers of the Endless Woods, wandering through the Rift until they die. Or they stumble back into the mortal world in a random patch of Rift Wood, possibly on the opposite side of the world, driven mad by the horrors of the Endless Woods. Creatures and plants can make their way around the world in this way as well and wander into the Rift, where they become inhabitants of the Rift itself. 

Upon significant events in the material world, like the founding of an important city, a battle or the creation of an especially holy sight etc., a similar location will come into existence in a corresponding place in the Rift. Negative events like battles or especially grisly murders spawn a place haunted by the deepest and darkest horrors of the Rift. While positive events like an especially heroic act or similar things will create one of the rare sanctuaries of the Rift. Here mortals and other beings wandering the Rift can find a safe haven for a short while. As with all places in the Rift, these suffer from volatile topography and shifting surroundings as well. Unless guided by someone in the know it is highly unlikely for people to come out of the Rift in one piece.


####Notable Locations within the Rift:

**Oneiros, the City of Sleep**: At the center of the plane, suspended in mid air, hovers a white city, Oneiros, the city of sleep. Here those who have earned a reward, dream away the time. It is also the primary home of the Apokryph in the Rift.

**Endless Woods**: A woodland haunted by those deemed unworthy to enter Oneiros. It is overrun by the nightmares of the Damned, who are forced to prey on each other for eternity. The topography and geography is permanently shifting and the Woods are shrouded in near complete darkness.

**Rift Woods**: Patches of crystalline tree like structures that grow in wooded areas on land or coral reefs under water. They can be found in the material plane and the Rift. These patches of crystalline woods mark the entrances/exits of the Rift.
