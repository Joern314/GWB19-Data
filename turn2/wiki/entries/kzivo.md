**Sphere**: Caves

**Description**: 
Kzivo appears as a large limestone man with stalactites coming off his arms and replacing what would otherwise be hair. The whole thing gives him a melted look. He carries around a large and strange pickaxe.

His exact origins are unknown; Gon Gryn awoke one day to find him simply working on expanding the caves in the shattered mountains. It is his job. Apparently he is the brother of Olasea, Minor Goddess of Erosion.
