The Sorcerer aware of there suddenly being souls loose in the world descended to the prime material plane. Another god had killed some mortals for sport. And now tried to pass himself off as the god of death.

"I am the Sorcerer, the god of magic and death. And I will tell you this. These creatures are called the Unliving. If your life ends you will become one of these base and vile creatures. Destroy their brains and they shall fall to death. But beware the magic that comes from the end of a life."

With a swift motion he crushed the head of one of the Unliving and the magic exploded of the body as it was not used.

"The imposter claims this to be his doing, but everyone can make a person one of the Unliving by killing them. Even you mortals. So do not fear or worship the imposter for things he has not earned, invented or done. In fact I will do something he can not. I will return the Unliving from the dead. For they have lived too short of a life to be damned to the nightmare of the Endless woods or the blessings of the Sleeping city, which awaits all mortals after death in my world called the Rift."

Thus spoke the Sorcerer and brought back from the dead those the imposter god had slain.
