Lyva had definetly noticed that the oceans were now a thing, as the birth of the Great Salt was certainly not something that could be missed. With the Great Salt, of course, came the Salty Knave, who returned to visit the dragon, now no longer an echo.

Her approach was heralded by the playful sound of a kiss being blown, just behind Lyva. When she turned, of course there was no one there, but instead she felt presence resting on her head. This time, however, it was no longer a fleeting feeling of wetness but instead, finally something more *physical*. 

There was a *woman* lying belly down on her head, gently caressing her forehead with a finger. And she no longer felt *wet* to the touch, but it was still a bit misty around her.

She was lying on her head, so the dragon could not see her, but, somehow, Lyva could *feel* her blue lips, and her wolfish grin.

*"missed me, babe?"*
