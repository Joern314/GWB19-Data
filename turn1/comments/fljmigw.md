With a small degree of fear Sunda, as he had been officially named, took the first chance to scurry away, deciding to take the time to recover.

He was annoyed, both at himself for losing and Lyva for besting him. But there was one thing he swore he heard, one thing that helped ease his ire.

She had called him her son. Oh, sure, she'd tried to play it off as an error or some such thing, but he knew what he heard.

And so Sunda, making his way back out into the wilds of the nearly empty universe, laughed.

The scale had been traded for the horn, that was simple enough (even if the loss of his horn annoyed him greatly).

But he had gotten family, a mother, out of this adventure. By refusing to acknowledge Sunda as her son Lyva had denied herself a part of *that* trade.

He'd come out ahead.
