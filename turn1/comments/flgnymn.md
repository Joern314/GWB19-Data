Prismari senses the first metaphysic come into existence it was a death one but.... it didnâ€™t seem half as bad as the one on his home world. But it gave him an idea these unliving creatures would likey be the first of many terrors that would need to be kept in  check and it  was the perfect opportunity to create something to help the future mortals and would be heroes of the world 

With kains help prismari design a metaphysic that was mostly based off from the world kain was born. 

And soon the legend of the heroes was spring in to existence

Legends of the heroes 

Creator: Kain  & prismari 

Turn created : 1 

The Law: Mortals who embrace their Legend shall grow stronger as it grows, but Legends never die.

Explanation: When a Non-Incarnate Mortal has the desire to change the world, they open themselves up to the Legends of the heroes . Specifically, they open up the possibility to build their Personal heroic Legend. This turns them into a Heroic Mortal. Heroic Mortals do not need to be "Good" or "Evil," they only need the desire to make a change in the world.

Heroic Mortals grow their Legend by growing their reputation (or fame) in the eyes of other mortals. However, Legend will only grow if you actually did what people think you did. You can't just claim credit for what other people do. Your Legend will not grow if you are anonymous either, people need a name to attach to your deeds in order for you to gain Legend. That name can be a pseudonym, though.
Heroic Mortals are able to draw upon their Legend to fuel greater deeds. Those with powerful Legends will be able to achieve superhuman feats, although they will never get strong enough to solo a Demigod. This can become a self-reinforcing feedback loop of Greater Powers leading to Greater Deeds leading to Greater Powers.
There is a cost to Heroism. Heroes Never traditionally Die, but are instead consumed by their Legend. Sure there body may pass with a magical explosion which depending on the size of the legend may be larger and become a unliving but yet A small portion of Their souls will never pass on to an Afterlife, but will instead linger as a portion of their Legend, In the form of an artifact that can gift future heroes with a bit of past heroes abilities (that cost players at the least 2 acts )
