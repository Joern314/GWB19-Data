It took moments to consider, but a few hours to create.

Crafting life was tricky, challenging, it required that everything be done in its time. To rush would be to invite disaster, to dally would equally be so.

But eventually he had made what had been requested of him: The so called "puppies of the depths".

They were small things, the adults only the size of a small wolf, and covered with a thin coating of fur. A sleek design, reminiscent of sharks, better for swimming in the water. Gills, so as to breath under the sea, a proper set of lungs, so as to breath the air while on land.

The tail was long, turning into a proper tail-fin, and the paws had to be changed a bit. Wider gaps between the toes, with some webbing between them to further assist in the water. Sharp claws, not unlike a cat, and sharper teeth would let it hunt in the water.

Smaller fins were placed on forelegs and hind legs, just above the elbow/knee joint completed the look.

Sunda considered his newest creations, smiling at them as they rolled around on the shore he had found. Some played in the waves, others roughhoused on the sand, but all stayed together. Pack mentality was important after all.
