Azrakal was sharpening the scale he got from [a big serpent](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgl2wf/?context=10000)

He saw a new god, this god did things of death, a place where the living does not want to go.  
Such knowledge, of such a thing, could be *powerful*, Azrakal got a glint in his eyes.  

He searched to find some being, a thing of minor power, a recorder. A figure carrying a scroll that he was writing on.

"Greetings, fellow friend, I am Azrakal, and who might you be?"

"I am The recorder, I write all things happening down. What is must be written. And that is my duty."

Azrakal smiled at the minor god.  
"Say, I heard some new creations came to be, a god of death and his mighty plans, for a recorder, you should see what he have done, to make sure the record remains truthful."

The Recorder nodded  
"That does sounds good, all things should go by my pen."

Azrakal pointed toward the Sorcerer  
"Go to him, ask him the secrets of death, so you can always have a knowledge of what mortals have died and how, after all, is not deaths just as important are births?"

The Recorder nodded again and left.

The Minor god, The Recorder ventured to the Sorcerer.  
"Greetings, God of Death. I am The Recorder, I have come to ask of you the secrets of Death, so that I may always keep the record correct of all things that die."

The Minor god was very respectful, bowing before the Sorcerer.
