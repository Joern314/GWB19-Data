Azrakal was sitting and suddenly, a huge rumble as the comet crashed on to the planet.  
Well, that was something.  

He watched the strange new well in the land formed around the impact site, it seemed to glow with energy to his eyes.

And when something had something, he wanted to see how *powerful* it was.  
But going over there yourself seems like a stupid idea.  
Now when humans was a thing, some minor gods had come in to existence to aid them. Such as... Minor God of Healing.  
Such a being could be useful.

So Azrakal approached the minor god after cutting himself, of course, the Minor God was a bit alarmed and said he would help but Azrakal just brush the minor god away, stating he was a god, a minor god of healing would not do, and he need to get something far more powerful, such as knowledge of healing itself.  
After all, he just heals stuff, he is not healing itself.

Azrakal pointed the minor god toward the calamity that happen, and said he found things away there that could be of help.

The minor god hurried away toward the pool to gleam it's secrets, while Azrakal waited and played with his dagger, he was going to tear the knowledge out of him after.

[Edit: Figure I pull this ahead, considering your god is technically not there.]

The Minor god of healing investigated the great source of life, after learning the secrets of healing, he rushed back toward Azrakal.  

He found Azrakal gone and then he was grabbed by him. 
Azrakal explained that he could give the knowledge of healing or suffer great pain.  
At first, the healing god did not spoke a word, then the carving started, Azrakal carved the minor god of healing slowly, giving him plenty of time to heal himself.

To be fair to the minor god, he did hold on for quite a while, but after enough carving with the dagger, he let out some small secrets of healing.

Azrakal was happy and threw the minor god of healing away, back toward the pool, maybe however made it will see some use for him.
