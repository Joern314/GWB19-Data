"Yeah." Lyva said bluntly, looking up from her bloody work briefly, "Don't worry, Protection Goddess, I'm not going to hurt him, I'm just taking his skin. It's a very generous trade on my side, he was probably going to shed this skin soon anyway when his new one comes in."    

Her serpentine tail coiled around Azrakal's throat as she shifted, seemingly unaware that human-like beings didn't normally shed like snakes. "Anyway, this is my universe, so just wait and I'll welcome you properly once I'm done her- whoops! Uh... I'll just put that back- blood god, stop wriggling, you're making this harder, and protection god, stop distracting me."      

She cauterised a muscle she had accidentally severed, burning it until it stopped bleeding, then continued her flaying work, most of the figure now skinless.
