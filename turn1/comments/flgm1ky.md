When  she still did not move the tentacle approached closer this time, slowly winding it's way closer towards her, though it did not make physical contact.

"(Incomprehensible gibberish)" the tentacle rumbled softly, perhaps due to much of it's bulk being rather far away right now.

\[Malaphet talks in gibberish except under specific circumstances but is still intelligent(probably, hard to tell with Great Old Ones) , feel free to interpret the gibberish as you wish)
