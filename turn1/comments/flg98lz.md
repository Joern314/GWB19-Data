**Dreams of Divinity**

*“Gegbo onomāl! Ililm! Ililm!! Ililm!!! Sssrelālorsss!!!” The scaled guard on the distant tower called frantically as the sky roiled overhead.*

*To the left a creature with black scales and purple feathers craned its head to eye Gon and opened its maw of sharp teeth to speak in a gravelly voice.*

*“Eg esss gemo… Loidāl, Rrrela?”*

“Yes, yes, I’m rea-” Gon replied groggily as he sat up and tried to sooth his throbbing head by rubbing it with one hand. With a yawn he took in his surroundings which, besides a distant looking space storm, seemed to be absolutely devoid of everything. He was *fairly* certain that he hadn’t gone to sleep in such a barren place, but then again…

“Well, I do feel different… I wonder if it worked… or if this is just what the afterlife looks like? How... bland.” The gryn god muttered to himself as he lazily dragged The Retaliator from the rough scabbard on his hip. 

Gon studied its appearance closely. The blade still retained its feather-like shape, but the blade had turned a deep black instead of the green tinge that he was used to. The guard was still in the shape of golden wings and the pommel was still a bird head with three eyes; one emerald, one diamond, and one ruby. The rough leather wrapping even still hinted at the ghouls it had sliced open with its strange odor and black color. Only difference was that now the sword was powerless; little more than a hunk of metal. With any luck, however, it was a divine hunk of metal. Gon sighed and returned the blade to its home on his hip.

As he pondered his situation, he lifted his left hand up to straighten an errant feather on his head absentmindedly, only to notice a peculiar golden symbol glowing slightly on the back of it. Vaguely familiar, Gon stared at it until he realized it was moving.

“Srukzek. Hrrm… A divinity manipulation scar, perhaps? You, my friendly rune, are just going to have to wait. Let’s see…” Gon laughed to himself as he perked back up and threw his head back to bellow out into the void with a note of sarcasm:

“As much as I find barren nothingness soothing to my soul, it is sadly particularly devoid of any desires! Any natives around?! Lyva?! You around here?!”
