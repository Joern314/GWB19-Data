"Hello, Prismari, Kain said you got lost out in the void, how'd you manage that? Glad to see you survived. Lyva would not be pleased to lose her possessions." Gon greeted the familiar god with a slight bow. 

"So you intend to create heroes? Tyfelsegg was certainly not a kind place for mortals... and by the... feelings I am getting from this world this may not be so nice either. It is a strange feeling when gods alter the reality of worlds isn't it? I am not used to it."

"Ah, but that reminds me, that I need to restore some power to The Retaliator... I guess it would be useful to have it cleave souls again." Gon laughed.
