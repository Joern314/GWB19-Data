"Austere?" Lyva giggled, then did her best to straighten, looking a little taller and more formal, "That's a first. But very well, I do need to prepare to invest so..."   

She screwed up her face in concentration as the pocket reality buckled and seemed to go through a hurricane. Everything moved, leaped, jumped and rearranged, tumbling over itself and inside out, before abruptly freezing once more.    

Now it resembled a museum, with a forest of low plinths holding items Lyva clearly assumed would impress her new friend. Forging tools, from ancient ingots to elaborate hammers, books of spells lying temptingly closed, shrunken heads and woven family trees, a tiny star and a fungal dress. 

"Better? -tter?" Lyva asked, voice echoing as another Lyva, this one a glowing ethereal form inside her own pocket dimension peered around the portal, a hand offered to help her through. The Lyva in the material realm pursed her lips and went still, apparently focusing hard to manifest inside herself. "It feels less organic and cosy, but probably easier to browse. Just no stealing, but you seem trustworthy!"
