Prismari grabbed lyva face and kisses her head as if to check if she was real once confirmed he spoke

 “well when i suddenly wasnt in your pocket, Prismari assumed the worse!  I missed you greatly lyva ! “ he said as kain gracefully landed next to the two of them. If lyva was paying any attention he would remind her of an older prismari who looked slightly like a hobo 



“ nice to finally meet the one he wouldn’t shut up about  , I am the great kain marson of the clan of... well that doesn’t really matter much here.” Kain said with a shrug “as for how the two of us got here. That would be my doing ! “ kain said with a tone that gave the impression he has already done more then enough work 



“Oh ya that kain he’s a weird guy who saved me from the void when you left me to die ! Are you the only other one here “ prismari said playfully then hugged lyva with a strange strength he didn’t have before
