[A few questions that are probably be common.]    
[What is the dividing line where a dead mortals injuries will also prove fatal to the Unliving? Like, will a decapitated guy come back or is a headless Unliving immediately dead again?]   
[What is the time before an Unliving rises? Have people got a small window to cremate the body or something?]     
[Do Unliving breed new baby Unliving, or new baby mortals?]
