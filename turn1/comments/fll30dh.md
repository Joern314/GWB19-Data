Feeling a new presence in the rare lively spots of the growing world, Lyva set out to investigate. She appeared as a metallic woman with horns and a long tail, skin like bronze dressed in a flowing orange dress. 

"Hello? Is anything interesting here?!" She called curiously, and noticed a leaf on the ground, bent and turned it over, before nodding. "Yup. Lots of interesting things here."

Apparently pleased, she ate the leaf, and began to prowl the forest, collecting and devouring.... stuff. Unique leaves, flowers, stones, nuts, she happily examined and seemed to find them interesting, only to eat them after a few seconds.
