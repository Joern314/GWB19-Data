# The Forge Alights

"The forge must arise."

Oryllia took her hammer, and swung it into the primordial sludge that birthed her. It lit ablaze with her familiar violet flames, bubbling and boiling until a mist arose. The mist magically hardened into stone, shaped into a pit surrounding the sludge. Pillars arose from mist, raising a large dome-shaped ceiling high into the air. And thus, the Hexforge alit.

# First of the Thirteen Hexes: The Soil Shrieks

Oryllia looked over the world that was being formed by the other gods. The blood-soaked plains, the air, the crafted mountain. She saw much more to curse. Her mind was on Sarah. The innocent goddess of shadows.

The forge's embers blazed with immense fury. Oryllia worked away on her anvil, crafting a Hex perfect for a new world. She poured every ounce of pain into this first creation of her. The screams of the things uncreated, now given a voice in the world.

# New Plane: The Hexforge

A long palace made of darkened stone, illuminated by purple flames and suspended by pillars. It ends in a forge with an anvil, covered in runes, and a pool of purple molten sludge, which bears every profanity within it.
