A single scale floated down through the empty world, having been knocked loose at some point from the body of a frustrated Lyva.

It floated throughout the empty world, being struck by the storm bolts of Prismari and Kain, bathing in the maddening energies of Malaphet. It flew throughout the World, taking in parts that other gods cast off, scraps of energy and power that was twisted and turned and combined with the last echo of... something.

The echo, what little was left of it after so long, held the memories of worlds untold, of beginnings and endings, of stories and games, of wars against hatred itself.

This echo, which was partially made up of the Domain of Animals, combined with the want and greed of Lyva, spawned something new.

Sunda, a twisted animal, was born that day.
