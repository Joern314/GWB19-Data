"Beyond gods...?" Gon wondered out loud and stroked his chin in thought. He stepped close to Oryllia and started walking around her and looked her up and down, his curiosity making him forget about personal space.

"So you are born of this material... that is very interesting... so these 'dregs' were able to create a divine being like yourself?" Gon asked. 

"That is pretty amazing, I suppose that confirms that there is some divinity to this primordial force. And you were shaped by it too...? I am sorry if we woke you up. I suppose if you have been here in a dormant state you wouldn't know too much about what this world was like before we got here would you?" Gon commented with a broad grin, still continuing to circle her.
