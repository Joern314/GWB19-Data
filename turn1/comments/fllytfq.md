Then she leaned back, forked tongue licking her lips, and smiled fiercely.

"Goddess of Theft? Did the universe make you to tease me? Hmmph, I hate thieves, but you're... good." She whispered, "Be careful trying to steal from me. I flayed the last god to steal from me."   

Then Lyva flicked a hand over her ear, the earrings reappearing there, jumbled out of order, "But this is my universe, so I suppose everything in it is mine, wherever it is, and I'm not against sharing with my *friends*."
