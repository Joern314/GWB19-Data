Azrakal watched, waiting for the Recorder to return, he had his dagger finished and now he could use some more knowledge of *powerful* things.  
Then he saw the Recorder return, in a pitiful, pathetic shape.

Interesting, the minor god was just a humble servant of reality, performing his duty as it should, yet, it got itself turned out like that.  
How violent and uncivilized.

Then Azrakal took out the Blood Dagger, came behind the Recorders unliving body and cut it's head clean off.  
Azrakal drank of the blood, he wanted to know how it turned out like that, what changed him, how it changed him, such *power* is useful.

It was but a small crumb of knowledge in him, but it would do for now.
