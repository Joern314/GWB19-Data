The skull had changed much since it had appeared in the bleak void that Gon had woke up in. A continent had been raised from its surface by a collection of strange gods, littered with a race he remembered from the last world, and now there was a great ocean. But only one place for mortals? All of the mortals? That would never do. Especially...

Gon glanced at the notes scratched into the rough stone tablet he was holding. Another cruel world was forming and Gon would not make the mistake his father had. No. These mortals would be expendable. He wouldn't need to care for them. But he would give them a continent far from the race that seemed like it came from the previous world. It was time to build a new continent. 

Gon pulled from his robes a large number of stones, each marked with a crude symbol. These he dropped with care into the ocean far from the existing continent in a great curving line. Satisfied where they landed, he drew the black blade from the scabbard on his hip and held it high above him. 

"Segano srelam rano. Sebilk srelam srelo. Slekzo!"

The words were followed by a swing of the obsidian blade and a slash mark appeared on the skull, connecting the places where the stones had fell. It was not clean enough for Gon's liking, but it would do. Now he just needed some great force to uplift it. With a mad grin, he held his arms out in front of him and poured out some of his divine power. Stones of all shapes and sizes began form and to collect before the half-bird deity. Slowly but surely a massive stone full formed and then another. As each was gathering, Gon flung precious gemstones into the bases of each until they sparkled in the sunlight. After some time a whole mountain range waited above his chosen site, held in place with his power.

With a mad laugh that echoed from the mountains, he let his power subside from them. And yet, they fell too slowly. Their collision with the skull on the far side of the part he had slashed open uplifted one side to form great cliffs as the the other partially buckled under the force of the mountain range as a massive earthquake rattled the skull. The mountains themselves crackd and shattered partially from the impact, creating endless crevices and leaving with a sharp tops and an overall jagged appearance.

But it didn't seem to be enough. Water still sloshed in between the mountains in the east and the uplifted cliffs to the west.

"Srukzek! How hard is this thing?" Gon cursed in frustration.
