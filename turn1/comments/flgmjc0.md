"**One should keep an eye out of things that can take what is yours! I had the might to take a bit, so I did!**"

Azrakal moved with his *powerful* strokes but he knew getting away from the serpent might be tricky.   
So, only one thing to do, shed some blood.

He used the metal scale to cut his own arm, letting out a small spray of blood, this blood he aimed at the serpents head, by blinding it, he can simply stop moving and turn around, leaving the serpent to continue the chase without him.

Maybe it need some exercise done.
