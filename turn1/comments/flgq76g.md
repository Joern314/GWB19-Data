"Hrrm. Would you have really brought me back? That'd have been expensive." He eyed her suspiciously before laughing.

"Well then, guess that is settled. Excellent. Sorry about up and vanishing, I didn't expect that to happen when I tried to ascend."

Gon spread his hands out wide. "What would be the most incredible gemstone? Aha! Wait... but how do I... Let's try this."

"Segano srelam rano, sebilk srelam sremo!" He yelled as he slammed his hands together in front of him. As he did, the new rune on the back of his left hand brightened and his existence seemed to scatter somewhat. This caused Gon to pause before smiling and pulling a part his hands to reveal a large diamond cut into the shape of Lyva herself.

"A bit of payment for breaking the promise that I'd stay until you wanted rid of me." Gon laughed.
