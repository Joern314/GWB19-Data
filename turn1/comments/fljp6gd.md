The snake fell silent as no further retorts came from Lyva.

In godsight Lyva noticed that the snake was full of divine energy, fragments of devoured souls and magma lingering in the snake's rather empty stomach. There also was a single egg in the snake's body, half as large as the planet Lyva and the others had painstakingly crafted with their own hands. 

This creature was probably a god, holding the spheres of "Instincts" and "Surrender".
