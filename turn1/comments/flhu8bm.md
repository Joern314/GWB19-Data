After a little time as the other gods used their power to shape this world, large fields of grain popped up in the empty spaces of the earth. Each field was tended by a different grain spirit, all full of energy and itching to use it. At some point in time these grain spirits decided to compete with each other in races across the land trying to spread their grains the farthest and the fastest. One spirit named Shilo continued to win these competitions, winning power over each competitors fields until all the fields were his. Still full of energy, this marble statue looking spirit continued to interact with the mortals in this early time of creations, challenging them to different competitions and rewarding them with grain depending on how well they did.
