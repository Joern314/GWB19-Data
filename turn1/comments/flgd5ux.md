Prismari noticed the skull that was shot on to the sky and pointed it out to kain who admittedly had flash backs to the god eater of his hone world. So after much discussion the two split up prismari went for the god that spit out the head and kain went to investigate the skull that was spit out hoping to find no divine essence in it 

When prismari approached the strange new being he yelled out 

“HELLO IM PRISMARI THE FORMER COLOUR OF THE SEA... NOW GOD OF HEROES ! WHO ARE YOU ?” He yelled with all his might 

Meanwhile kain was looking over the skull with god sight hoping there was no left over divine spark
