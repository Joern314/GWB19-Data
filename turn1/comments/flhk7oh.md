Malaphet had watched the new deity that smelled similar to his meal float up and stare into one of his larger eyes, curiously it watched as the entity pulled out a strange item, almost like a false tooth. As the other gods had been non-violent with him as of yet, Malaphet had no reason or comprehension that they would want to hurt him. When Azrakal struck, Malaphet was momentarily surprised before the pain set in and the beast roared in pain and rage so loudly all that had been created so far could hear the cry just as they could see the eye swell up into and angry red ball of fire and rage that illuminated everything that was not under cover, casting away the darkness and close enough to give anything living on the surface of the planet a mild sunburn almost instantaneously.

As his eye swelled up so did one of his tentacles, quickly gaining the size large enough to wrap around the planet several times. The swollen tentacle swatted Azrakal into the ground hard enough to shatter the land for miles around the impact zone, not that it would be noticeable as the tentacle followed Azrakal down grinding him further into the ground before coiling around the planet to smack him again, leaving a immense gaping trench encircling the world.

The tentacle then withdrew from the planet as the majority of Malaphets mass, including the swollen eye moved away from the planet to nurse it's wound. The eye never seemed to recovered and remained swollen and angry, with a deep red spot where the blade had struck, but at it's new distance it only provided enough light to illuminate the planet and damage those that stayed exposed for a couple hours.
