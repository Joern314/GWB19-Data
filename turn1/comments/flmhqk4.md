"I'm sorry, I don't think we quite understand you" Thool said dissapointedly. Well, either way, my name is Thool. I am the god of the trees and the seasons. But I suppose it is difficult for the seasons to change without a moon. Would you like to help me make one?" Thool holds up two leaves, one green and one red. If you would like to help, point at this one!" Thool gestures with the green leaf. "And if not, just point to this one". Thool holds up the red one.
