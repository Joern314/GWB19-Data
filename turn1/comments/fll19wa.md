**The Birth of Thool**

As the new world began cycling between (day and night, cold and warm, screaming and quiet)  this process of change gave birth to a new being, a being that shifts and changes just as this cycle moves. At first when the world was cold and barren, Thool appeared as an elderly humanoid man, wearing the pelts of indecipherable animals and carrying a torch for light and warmth. As the days became longer and the trees regain their leaves, Thool too has undergone a change. She is now a beautiful young woman with hair of gold. Her torch too has changed into a lute that she strums among the trees. The trees, as if responding to her melody, regain their leaves and buds. 

As the planet warms and the days pass, Thool again transforms. This time she appears much younger, like a humanoid child. Not far from her is a brown-furred beast nearly three times her size! It does not appear outwardly aggressive, but an air of protection can be felt emanating from it as it follows its seemingly-young master through the forest. 

When the days grow shorter and the temperatures drop, Thool transforms again. Donning the look of a humble farmer, Thool dismisses her companion to hibernate for the coming months. Once her transformation is completed again, Thool's summons a harvest sickle, signifying the begining of the Autumn. 

The transformation of Thool eschews in a new season, and Thool themselves can will the seasons to change as they change their form.
