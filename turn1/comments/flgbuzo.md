Yet as she drew near, she found the object was closer and smaller than she had believed, and even seemed.... divine? Her eyes tracked the other stars, peering through creation as she felt the same essence through this entire corner of the cosmos.     

"So, another one's here." She announced loudly, a bright golden streamer swirling around before the vast eye. "Just as a warning, this is my universe, but I'll accept your present skull. It's good to have something in it."
