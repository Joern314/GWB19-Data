#Birth of the First Darkness#

The Void. 

Not exactly a place per se, for how could the nothingness, left behind by what was before, be a place? Yet some sort of a "place" it was, if only because this was where Sarah was created.

From the nothingness, she was created. The void became her. Nothingness became a being... And the first darkness.

Sarah opened her eyes, golden and beautiful.
Darkness was her hair, flowing and so long it nearly reached her pale feet. She was bound, wrists and ankles cuffed with gold, those in turn decorated with black gemstones and had golden chains connected to them. Upon her forehead rested an intricate diadem, golden in color as well.
Swirling mist hid most of her body from sight, shifting and turning but always maintaining the form of a long dress, albeit a moving one.
She looked around. Being new to the existence, she didn't know much, and so she decided to explore. Picking a direction, she started to walk.


{just to clarify, how does out-of-character chat work here? Also, how does normal roleplay work here? I am a little confused by the threads and the answers.}
