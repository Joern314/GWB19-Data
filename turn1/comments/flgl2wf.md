From the distance, floated a figure, and it heard this loud booming voice.  
Azrakal decided to investigate, after all, there was not much here. (Other than that giant skull and the thing above that).

Azrakal soon arrived at the serpentine creature and saw it's fine scales. Such fine scales could be very useful.  
Azrakal slowly floated up toward the serpent, making sure to stay at it's back, no need for it to see him after all.

And finally, he reached the serpent and saw one scale, close to one crack that he could grab on it, and so he did, he grabbed on and pulled with all his *Power*.

A loud snap and it was free, Azrakal then quickly started to go away, the serpent might not like that.
