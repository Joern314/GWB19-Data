A massive tsunami appeared in Oryllia's eyes, and it fell upon the shores of her mind. She could feel the disaster and distruction brought upon by the raging waters, but there were, in fact, no waters at all. Just waves crushing in her mind's eye. drowning out her thoughts. She saw, though it was not real, a woman dressed in silver foam, grinning with cerulean lips, but she was distant, a shape on the roiling water.

*"Yours to curse, mine to meddle.  
Just like hexes,  
Mine to scream, yours to peddle.  
Be wary, fiery witch,  
Your spells spell trouble  
And I am such a bitch,  
I could make it double"*

The seas calmed, and washed away from her mind.

*"This is nothing but a dream, all for nought  
Think of the mischief we could have brought"*

Oryllia's hammer exploded into bubbles, that cackled as they popped.

*"Hammer of witch  
Giggle of bitch  
Bubbles and Troubles  
Fires and Spiers  
Hear me thrum  
Hear ye hum  
Something wicked this way comes~"*

But it all was not real, so her hammer was still hers to hold, exactly as it was.

Or was it?

[I know it's all enigmatic, that's because my Goddess has yet to be born so her meddling for now is just an echo of a future that is soon to be. Paraphrased, the Knave is just commenting that the two of them could have fun together, as she is all about mischief, and so it would be fun to play with curses]
