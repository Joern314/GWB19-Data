"People want different things, you'll know that. You don't want the universe, but everyone wants something. And I want everything. I want you and your hammer and this universe, and this cool rock I found on the way here!" She suddenly stabbed a finger into her sternum, and a crack then an opening spread across her chest. Lyva eagerly reached inside and removed a small dense meteorite with clear delight, holding it up for Oryllia to see.

"It was just floating in nothingness. It could be from universes away, and it's the shape of a kidney." She explained, proud as a child at show and tell. "Like I said, I don't do dregs. Everything matters, everything has value. And I want everything, so I'll claim this universe is mine, and sure someone is going to object, but what's desire without challenge?"

"I've seen mortals hold onto a land against endless tides because they lived there. There were better places to live, they could move there without issue, but blood had been spilled for that patch of land, that little farming village, and that sacrifice gave the place value, inspired them to live there and grow there." Lyva grinned, a sharklike smile of triangular steel teeth, "If they tell me no, I'll want this universe more, and if they tell me yes, I'll have them too. Like you and Malaphet, you're *my* friends now."
