The call was picked up by eager ears, and Gon quickly felt a strange sensation, like the feathers on the back of his neck standing on end as something approached as if swimming through the metaphysical. 

Then something small, dense and metallic hit him with the force of a meteor as a familiar goddess from another universe slammed into him and hugged him tight. Lyva stood a little smaller than him, athletic build framed in a bright golden skin, while her long tail looped around them a few times, squeezing just enough for it to be painful. She felt more organic than before, the hard panels of her youth melted and sculpted into her form, and her horns framed drifting white hair in a golden halo of sorts.       

"Mine." She whispered after a long moment, hugging him tightly and possessively.
