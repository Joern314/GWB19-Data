"Earth is one of my domains, I am merely repeating what I was told it should be called, but truly it is all the stone and soil, the building blocks of the land. Caves and clay. Crystals and treasures hidden deep below. All of these things. Most divinities seem to use 'Earth' as the term to cover that. I am afraid I do not know why. Where I came from, the inhabitants believed the land to be merely the surface of a large egg. Perhaps egg would have been a more accurate term." Gon explained happily before looking towards the skull planet.

"As for that thing, I name it 'Ranosken' but that is not a name yet recognized by others. Do you have a name for it yourself?" He asked with curiosity.
