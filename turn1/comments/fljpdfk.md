[Now I can introduce you to the concept of multiple-god conversation (you might notice me doing a lot of tagging)    
in short, we try to keep it in one chain, and let each god get a word in.  

This event is know as *my flaying*.  
I link up this chain with the other chain. 

Multiple god conversation tend to take a lot of time.]

"Why would I care what I am called? I am *Power*! I can call myself what I want! The Strong rule the weak! And I Wi- What the?"
