Lyva's dark metal form was suddenly immersed in a storm of debris, yet hardly a sound of stone on metal was heard. Instead Lyva collected the stones into her hoard to sort later, and a dark black portal silhouette charged out of the dust, only to shrink, buckle and seemingly implode into nothingness.

Then a golden portal ripped open underneath the chimera, and a blade lashed up on the end of Lyva's tail now. It barely missed his throat, shearing past his mane, and wrapped around one horn in a sudden display of flexibility as her shoulders and arms caught around his neck. The beast was turned upside down, slammed off the mountain into the valley below by the force of the metallic goddess with a sharp **crack**, and as the world resolved itself, he found Lyva perched on him, a foot on his neck, holding a broken off horn in her hand.

"Stronger and smarter." She hissed, turning the horn up to poke it towards the beasts eye threateningly. "But I'm not desperate enough to eat you. I'm hungry, and eating another hungry god would only make me twice as hungry. So I'm taking this instead, so you can remember this, and remember what I tell you."     

"I am not your mother. I am Lyva, Goddess of Metal and Greed, and I trade, or I invest, I do not gift. This is my trade, one of my wonderful scales, for your crooked little horn, son...." She abruptly blinked, caught herself and stumbled, "...da. I'm calling you Sunda. Not son. Because I've got plenty of names, and I never use that one, and you need a name if you're not going to starve."
