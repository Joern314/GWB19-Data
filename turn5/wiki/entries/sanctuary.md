The Hunting Grounds were the ancestral home of humanity. Made by Rictus and traveled by his people under the guidance of the Iron Judges it was home to many nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes of humans, using the magical arrows Rictus had given their forefathers to hunt.

Their is however one town where the Iron Judges meet to deliberate on recent events, religious matters and tribal business. The place is called Sanctuary. Where outside the tribes often squabble over the best places to hunt, sources of water or the best trees to make arrows from in Sanctuary the Iron Law reigns supreme and no one dares to break the law given to humanity by their creator and patron Rictus.

It is no one wonder then that the center of worship for Rictus is also Sanctuary. The people of Sanctuary try to live by the Iron Law and try to educate visitors on the Iron Law in accordance with the teachings of Rictus. The town of Sanctury is the holy land of Rictus.
