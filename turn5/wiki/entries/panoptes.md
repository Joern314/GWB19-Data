The Sorcerer remade the divine soul of the Recorder, a minor god he had killed as it was sent by Azrakal to spy on the Sorcerer, into Panoptes. He sits on the highest tower of Oneiros in the Rift and directs the Rift Keepers to their duty to collect souls.

Panoptes is a tall figure. Almost human. It just has hundreds of eyes all over its head. The  Panoptes means the all-eyed or allseer. 

Panoptes would look out into the Rift and the world and keep track of mortal lives and lifespans. He would record the deeds of the living and steer them towards an afterlife in the Endless Woods or Oneiros depending on their deeds. And he would dispatch the Rift Keepers living in Oneiros to collect the souls of the living back to the Rift.
