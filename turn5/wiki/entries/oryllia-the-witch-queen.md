# Oryllia, the Witch-Queen [Gods]

**Player**: /u/DragoneyeCreations

**Spheres**: Hexes and Contracts

**Appearance**: Oryllia appears as a feminine figure made of violet fire, with metallic pieces adorning her like armor. Most notably, a plate with long curling horns covers her eyes like a blindfold. She wields a hammer, covered in runes.

**Plans and Style**: Oryllia, being a goddess of hexes and contracts, seeks to curse both the land and individuals through various means. She lures mortals in via contracts with her, which will nearly always end in the mortal being cursed. Primarily, she will be feared, and those who actively worship her will be those pushed to the fringes of society for being profane.

**Origins**: Oryllia was born out of the dregs of creation, the profanity, the sludge that soon became the pit from which all of her Hexes came from.

**Further Explanation**: Oryllia is an evil aligned god, so expect plenty of chaos to come from her. Itâ€™ll be a mix of simple tricks and horrendous evil.
