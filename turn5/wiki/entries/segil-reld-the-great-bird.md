Seven bright stars, all with a green and purple hue marked the beak, wing tips, two legs, the end of the tail feathers, and one at the heart of the being, were filled in with duller stars to complete the image. All glistened like bright jewels in the heavens and the beak of the great bird was anchored above the Temple-Caves of Nkan'gbamo. It would be said that the bird always flew home.
