The oldest of these was the Society of the Sting, those human and yashool who showed Fidelity to the scorpion. These were the men responsible for eating the Unliving, an unpleasant, but honored task to control their unbearable competition. In the forest, great respect was shown to the ravens for their supernatural intelligence. The most elite human and yashool were initiated into the Society of the Black Wing. They would make elaborate feathered costumes and beaked masks to dance Fidelity to the raven. In the jungle, the Bearcat was king because of its supernatural strength. The elite, human and yashool, in their respective tribes, joined the Society of the Whisker, fashioning costumes and dancing Fidelity to gain an increment of this physical power.
