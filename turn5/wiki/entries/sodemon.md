This faction of Nkarlen is the most widespread, having fallen under the influence of Sunda, they have spread out across the second continent. More savage than the other goblins, they have been known to raid other villages from time to time. Known for their green skin, these goblins spend more time then the rest above ground.

Their center of power is Sralenkloon on the northern tip of Gbigolind.

Other settlements/cities include: Googebi in the Savage Jungles south of Kzivo'gbamo, Mukzek on the edge of the inland sea halfway between Nkan'gbamo and Amalah
