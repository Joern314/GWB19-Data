Heroized: [Turn 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/ftlhb9/endless_pantheon_turn_5_macro/fm9y8z2/) 

The first goblin to successfully stay on the back of a beardillo for a short period of time and survive.

Became the first goblin hero after he disappeared into the savage jungle and his legend grew. A skull was eventually recovered that is claimed to be his and grants the user unreasonable grip strength when tied to their body.

Died turn 4 (technically speaking)
