On the Kiln islands there is a patch of Rift Wood. It's Rift Trees have been carved into the shape of a gateway. On the hinges of this gateway are two heavy white gates. These gates are the only entrance from the prime material plane to the Sleeping City in the Rift.

So it should not come as a surprise that around these gates a settlement of Apokryphs have collected. Worshipping the Sorcerer they founded the city of Epoidos here to guard these gates to the afterlife.

While there is not yet much magic to study the Sorcerer intended for this town to become the worlds premiere center of magical learning. The town where the knowledge of everything magical in this world is kept. A veritable holy land of the Sorcerer, where those wanting to learn his teaching can flock together.
