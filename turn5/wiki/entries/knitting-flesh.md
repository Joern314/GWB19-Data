Among mortals only the jumbled can make use of the powers this metaphysic bestows. It allows a jumbled to take body parts cut off of another person or corpse and sew them together. A living person can so be given use of a replacement limb if they lost their own.

If a jumbled sews together a roughly humanoid form from corpse or body parts the resulting body comes alive as a jumbled themself. The jumbled live a relatively normal mortal life with a normal life span, the only caveat being they can only reproduce by knitting together a new jumbled. Biologically these new jumbled can however perform any other task a normal human, goblin or whater flesh was used in their creation, can. (Even sex.)
