Among the people of the Hunting Grounds the story of a very special young boy is often told. He bragged to his friends that he could shoot his arrows farther than them, farther than their fathers and farther even than the hunters of the tribes, who were known to be the best shots on Primus.

The boy's friends were fed up with his bragging and demanded for him to show them. The boy couldn't however resist bragging one last time and let his friends pick where to shoot. And they to teach him a lesson wanted him to shoot the sky itself. 

The boy was not perturbed. He knew he could not possibly reach the sky with an arrow, but giving up without even trying seemed pathetic to him. And so he climbed a tall tree to improve his odds. He took aim and fired. And to the astonishment of the boy and his friends the arrow turned into a streak of silver and in the heavens stars appeared in the shape of an Arrow.
