#Crisis: Tumult in the Great Forest

Azrakal watched those lovely beasts, this was a opportunity to raise the mortals awareness, great *power* would be needed to gain all that blood.

He changed some dire beasts, to make them stronger, more powerful.

They would start to shake, grow bigger but their skin remained the same. Soon, they burst out from their skin prison, stronger, more bloodthirsty than before.  
The tales of the Flayed god might go hand in hand with those skinless monsters.
