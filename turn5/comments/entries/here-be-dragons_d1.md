# Here Be Dragons [None]

The knowledge of the people of Epoidos was not only limited to that of magic. But it surely made magic more mundane. So the stories the Apokryphs told each other were lands where tasks were not accomplished by the power of the Apokryphs innate magic or magic taught by the Sorcerer, but by fantastical beasts and self-moving machines powered not by magic but by unseen forces of nature or demons. Other stories told of lands cursed by Oryllia so no one could live there except maybe the Unliving.
