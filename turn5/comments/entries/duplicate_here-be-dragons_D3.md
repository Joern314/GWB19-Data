# Here Be Dragons [None]

The jumbled have little to no idea of the outside world. They know that cities are dangerous and liable to cause people misery, so they live mostly in small communities in rural areas, calling caves their homes, which they improved living in by virtue of their handiwork skills with stone and tools.

They do however tell many stories of the poor and hapless mortals who went to the cities to find their luck only to be eaten, chewed up and spit out again like Glypha had warned them.

The jumbled also often herd goats and move from cave village to cave village to make their living.
