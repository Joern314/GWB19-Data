These spells can be cast by anyone. Up to three times per day any combination of these cantrips can be used. They are influenced by the gods and their domains and allows mortals to channel magical power in an imitation of divine power for the following purposes:

God | Cantrip
:--|:--|
|**Azrakal** (Blood &amp; Power)|Consume blood for short boost of endurance.|
|**Dawri** (Fate &amp; Time)|Divination on planned events can give a feeling about it going right or wrong.|

|**Glypha** (Fear &amp; Flesh)|Evoke fear by illusion of rotten flesh.|
|**Gon Gryn** (Earth &amp; Vengeance)|Create small pit trap.|

|**Lyva** (Metal &amp; Greed)|Detect precious metals in vicinity.|
|**Mair** (Life &amp; War)|Mend minor cuts and bruises.|
|**Malaphet** (Stars &amp; Minds)|Navigate via stars.|

|**Rictus** (Law &amp; Hunt)|Detect stolen goods of yours.|
|**The Salty Knave** (Sea &amp; Theft)|Evoke sounds, smells or feelings of the ocean.|
