# The legend of the beast slayer and the wave that fallowed [None]

Rahab chief of the Zephon tribe had heard distressing rumours of grand beast... and it worried him greatly... and so he prayed to the hero god to intervene 

It was then a masked stranger with colourful hair entered the village asking around for the chief (-2 contact mortals ) 

Once the chief arrived Prismari proclaimed himself there god! Taking off his mask 

“I am  Prismari god of heroes! I have heard your call for aid.... I will do all I can to aid you in this task.” Prismari proclaimed much to the village’s delight 

“So that means your going to kill the giant animals right ?” One villager asked 

“It must be... just like he saved us long ago.” Another villager said 

“WRONG .... I’m here to advise your chief and train him slightly... if he chooses to do so  “ Prismari proclaimed loudly 


Rahab sighed it wasn’t like he had much of a choice and so he went into his hut with Prismari. Causing the people to whisper about how he was chosen by the gods. Causing the legend of the heroes to start taking effect much to Prismari enjoyment and rahab begain growing a bit stronger 

They trained for two hours well Prismari advises him on how to kill the new dire animals to the best of his knowledge... truth be told Prismari didn’t pay to much attention to animals and just gave basic advise that any hunter would know 

The real reason he was here was to help this would be hero take hold of his opportunity... being a little more forceful then he would of like... but desperate time call for desperate measures 

After the sparring and or training season Prismari said his good byes and sent the chief and his hunter  on their way well pointing him in the general direction he assume a dire animal would

The hunters and the chief tracked the dire wolf  for a week the large monster of a wolf frightened even the most seasoned of hunters 

But slowly and surely Rahab devised a plan of attack, well the best slept most of the hunter would hide and fire arrows at it well Rahab would be the bait and hopefully keep the beast attention 

That night they attempted the plan and it went horribly wrong , the beast paid now mind to the screaming rahab and began tearing apart his hunter person by person more annoyed at the fact it was getting shot with arrows 

In frustration Rahab ran toward the beast  and with an unearthly jumped landed on its back. He then used the demon slayer knife as a makeshift handle on the beast 

Slowly but surely he climbed his way to the beasts head where he stabbed its eye and then cut one of the muscles that connected the wolf’s jaw. With A final feat of heroic strength rahab ripped the jaw clean off and then pushing the knife feather in to the skull, killing the  beast saving the remaining hunter

Rahab and his surviving hunter returned to the village carrying the bones of a dire beast to be used in a grand future project. With Rahab the beast slayers legend cemented in the history of mortal kind it once again grew larger. In the future he want on to slay more and more dire beast earning the name of the beast slayer 

But even more important then that it set off a wave of heroes to fight the dire beast and other threats . Each and ever one of them creating there own legend. All oh whom demanded to be buried with there legends
