A curious chain of mountains hewns from very different kinds of rock giving it a very mixed appearance color wise. Different peaks are made from different colors.

The mountains are filled with caves. There are many streams running down the mountain and many pastures for the very common goats the inhabitants herd.

The foot is packed with dense forests and its typical flora and fauna.
