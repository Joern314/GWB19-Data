# Local Goods to Trade [None]

The hunters of the Hunting Grounds had no metals or gems or delicacies beyond the meat they hunted on offer. What they could do however was to offer their services to other cities as hunters or mercenaries. They could procure meat for people who had trouble hunting due to the animals burning upon death or provide able scouts to warn of raids by dire beasts or blood riders. In part this was because of the miracle given to the people of hunting grounds that showed the best among them were the chosen of Rictus, the Waidm√§nner.

They were given the power to have senses of smell, hearing and sight as sharp as the best predators. And their instincts provided them with additional information about the things they perceived, like age, health, injuries and in rare cases even intent. They could hide like the best stalking predators, often in plain sight. They had instant mastery with all the tools of a hunter, be it knife, bow, arrow or trap. And from the fiercest enemies they slew they could absorb increased powers, like a wild animals stamina or the power to see in the dark
