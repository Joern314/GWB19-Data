# The City on the Well [None]

The Worshipers of Mair have built a pale reflection of the Temple of Life, and they have begun to build a city around it. This City's Name is Gwanyin. Immigrants were initially drawn to the City by the promise of Life Essence. They were made to stay within the city by the easy access to life-saving Essence, and the comforts born of the City's rapidly advancing technology.
