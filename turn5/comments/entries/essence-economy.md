# The Essence Economy [The City on the Well]
Just as the City is physically centered on the Well of Life, its Economy is similarly centered upon the Life Essence drawn from the Well.

The Well is sheltered in the Temple of Life, a Fortress-Temple dedicated to Mair. It is a Sacred Place to the Men of Dernas, and the center of their City-State's Governance. It is a place of Healing, of Stockpiling Food against famine, and the last line of defense against those who seek to conquer The Well of Life. The Temple of Life is home to *two* Holy Orders. 

> **The Orders of the Temple**
>
> The Order of Life is the Peaceful side of the Temple. The Order's most important duty is drawing Life Essence from the Well of Life. They administer the Essence to the Sick and Wounded of Dernas, and they throw the bodies of those about to die *into* the well to avoid the rise of Deathless. Their least public, but most *significant*, duty is as the City's Administrative Class. They maintain the city's genealogical records, sign off on work orders, and see to it that the city's craftsmen and laborers are supplied with raw materials.
>
> The Order of War is a brotherhood of Warriors, the finest in Amalah. There are rarely more than fifty members of the Order living within the Temple at any given time. They are given a cup of Life Essence to drink every morning. They then spend the majority of their day *training* for war. Their Training Routine is intense enough that it would kill any mortal man, and includes sparring with sharpened weapons and *barely* pulling strikes. The Order's daily dosage of Life Essence allows their bodies to push through the agonizing trials, and recover in time to do it again the next day. They are known for their *calmness* in battle, for their training has rid them of the fear of death and pain. They battle in silence, calmly and efficiently slaughtering their enemies.

The Order of Life trades with the City-State's Farmers and Tribal Hunters, exchanging Life Essence for food. They also trade the Essence for other resources, such as raw metals and timber, necessary to fuel the city's construction, expansion, and maintenance. A vial of the Essence can be the difference between life and death for a hunter, for it can allow the body to recover from otherwise deadly wounds. It is even more valuable to a Farmer, who can sprinkle the Essence upon their fields and multiply their crop four-fold.

The City's Residents, Specialists and Laborers alike, are cared for by the Temple. Their Food and Supplies are procured by the Temple, secured in Warehouses and allocated in accordance with the Priests' Holy Wisdom. The city is kept in a steady state of expansion. New Housing, Workshops, Warehouses, and *Walls* are constantly being constructed.

The City's Purpose is to hold the Well of Life, and as such the City's Industry is focused upon fueling its war machine. Making advancements in Metallurgy and Craftsmanship win men a place in Song and *Legend* as surely as martial prowess, and Smiths and Bowyers are second only to Warriors in prestige. Architects and Engineers are the next most prestigious professions, for their minds give birth to new fortifications, massive weapons, and other defenses for the Well of Life.
