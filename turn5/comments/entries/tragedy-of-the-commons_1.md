# The Tragedy of the Commons [None]

With each Vazari responsible not only for themselves, but also their Unliving thralls, food became a contentious issue. To solve this issue and lay down laws among themselves they convened to create three different levels of society, The first would be the fully mortals, and food would be prioritized to this class, as they were needed to keep the Unliving in line. Next were the Pure Ones, the unliving whom died either due to injuries or sickness but were otherwise physically fit and well maintained who would be given food when it was available and generally kept well treated. The final layer would be the Impure Ones, these were the unliving who had been subjected to the Death of the Self at birth for some physical deformity. The Impure ones were the first to be sacrificed for magical rituals or used for more dangerous jobs.
