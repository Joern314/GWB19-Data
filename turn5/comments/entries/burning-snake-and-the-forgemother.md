# The Burning Snake and the Forgemother [None]

Perhaps not inaccurately, the depiction of Lyva as a promiscuous Goddess and mother of Sunda spread, and mingled with the Apokryph myth of her and the Sorcerer being parents of their race. Thus popular Apokyph myth prays to Lyva as the Forgemother, a Goddess of Metal, Creation and Birth, and unfaithful partner to the Sorcerer, God of Magic, Spirits and Death.     

Her serpentine half and greed itself is personified in another being, merged with the idea of the ancient mythic Gargantuan Serpent and the Serpent Constellation as the Sun Serpent. It is seen as an all devouring force of change, and worshipped for selfish purposes like a genie, and is often sacrificed to for people desiring selfish success.     

The Kiln Islands also naturally worship the Knave, having to deal with the seas treachery time and time again, and Thool for their food and seasons.    

During this period, Lyva also finally claimed her first prophet, a miner Apokryph called Erum, who she instructed to spread the news that she had ended the curses of Oryllia. While the story was told, the details often fluctuated. In some versions, Lyva made a bargain with the Witch Queen, giving her a child or seducing her to make a child, in some she tricked the Witch Queen with a fake contract, or defeated her in force of arms with a metal spear. Lyva quickly decided she liked the trickery option best, since no mortals seemed to believe that she had lectured her until she broke.       

Through Erum she also taught chants and essentials of trade to help her people, and urged her people to work together rather than fall into savagery once more.
