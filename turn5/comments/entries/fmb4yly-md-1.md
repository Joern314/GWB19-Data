Having heard cries for vengeance from the poor mortals who had lost family, loved ones, or those who had been maimed, Gon decided to become involved. To these people he appeared dressed in white robes with a crooked smile and a calm voice.

"I am Gon Gryn, God of the earth below your feet and the vengeance in your hearts. I have heard your desire for vengeance, your prayers for retribution. I have come to grant you a part of my power."

Gon bestowed on the mortals fighting the dire beasts petrification magic. This required them to take in the magic from an unliving creature who had been put down and redirect that energy to their target.

Petrification magic was not instant and could only be used from a short distance, but the living/unliving would slowly turn to stone from the point that the magic was directed to, until they had been rendered into nothing more than a statue. This spell does not permit this to be undone. To prevent becoming a statue, one must rid themselves of all of the parts that have started to turn to stone.

In their fight in the great forest, those who used this spell would come to realize that it effected everything, including trees and mundane animals. One should use care when using this spell, lest they turn something other than their intended target to stone.

Once Gon had passed this spell onto the mortals fighting in the great forest, he instructed Jikzek the Second on the use of this spell as well and bade him pass the knowledge to all of the goblins before Jikzek died.

\[-3 petrification spell; gradual and doesn't include a way to undo the petrification, -2 for contact mortals.\]
