# "Against the Grain" [None]

Glypha looked over the world. The cities that were growing on it were dirty places. They gobbled up mortals and put them to work as beasts of burden to run on and feed them. As such they were everything the mortals deserved for the way they often treated their dieing and dead.

But it was not the fault of the Unliving and the dead that they were treated thus. So for her experiment with divine power Glypha collected the remains of different mortal species. She failed many times. But in the end her first mortal was ready.

She called him Patchwork. A goblin who had lost his arms and got replacement human arms. He moved around like a little gorilla. Glypha made Patchwork her prophet. She taught Patchwork how to sew body parts together to produce others of his kind.

Then she taught the jumbled about the claustrophobic life in servitude and misery cities represented. Instead she bad them to wander and live life better than the respectless mortals who had created her and tortured their poor dead relatives.

They would however have to procure body parts to make themselves family. To make their lives outside of cities however easier Glypha taught the mortals how to shape stone and work with tools to a degree not often seen in mortals.
