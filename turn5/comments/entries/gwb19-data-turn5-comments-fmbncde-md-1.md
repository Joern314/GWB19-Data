News of Gon's appearance came to Wooxti-Kwashotl on the ravens Shata had sent out. Now that they had allies in the forest she set out with her troops on a great march into the depth of the forest to meet them. Shata shared her plans of battle and their camouflage armor, however the mortals no longer had need of weapons, bearing the power of petrification. 

The beast they stalked was a 20ft titan crane, somehow even more frightening than they expected. Some went mad just seeing its razor toothed beak. But, Shata was wise, and some of her soldiers were trained in the dance of the frog. They lured the titan crane with their mimicked croaks and swift hops to a tangle of nets in the canopy. Of course the great beast was too strong to be held long, but it was confused enough for the disciples of Gon to petrify one of its titanic clawed feet. The crane collapsed to the ground and was swarmed by yashool and humans armed with bronze weapons who stabbed it to death in minutes. 

Powered by blood lust, the army of Shata patrolled the forest and killed two more titanic beasts before returning in triumph to Wooxti-Kwashotl. Her army installed her on the throne, and the prophet ruled the city for 200 years of peace. Some of the forest dwellers came along and established a community of Gon worshipers in the city.
