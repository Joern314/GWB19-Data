# Local Goods to Trade [None]

For those who can overlook the often hideous and frightening exteriors of the jumbled they are happy to provide their services as masons and craftsmen, as their abilities in this area are second to non. They also offer to take care of any dying people and dispose of the Unliving they become.

The other thing the jumbled can offer are their skills in knitting flesh. Not only can the jumbled create new life by stitching together flesh of the dead, they can also “repair” people by sewing new arms, legs or other limbs to their bodies, if they lost them. They are no healers but if a bear mauled your arm and you need a new one a deal with a jumbled might be what you need to get a new one.
