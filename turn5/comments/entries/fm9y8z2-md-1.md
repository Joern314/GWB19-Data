**Heroes & Goblins - The Quest for the Skull of Roilenkar** 

As the goblins had spread out into the wider world the had encountered many fearsome beasts and either tried to skin them to make funny hats or tried to ride them. Ever since  Roilenkar had successfully rode a beardillo in the early days of goblin history, riding them had become a sport.

Roilenkar himself had vanished into the savage jungles many years ago, and yet legends lived on of his deeds slowly growing far greater than he could have ever been in life. Soon many spoke his name alongside Skaal'gbaldol as a true Nkarlen hero. As time passed there came a desire among the Misrei to discover his final resting place and recover his remains.

No Less than 14 expeditions were sent out from Kzivo'gbamo funded by the Nkan'sriggbol, or leader, of the Milerlo Mesrei who desired to have such an artifact in his hands. Of the approximately 280 goblins that set out only 45 were ever heard from again and only one succeeded. Most told tales of massive lizards with insatiable hunger and a few told of a den, a small cave where rotten rags and bones of a goblin remained, the skull having been broken by a stone that fell from the ceiling. They said that they had recovered this skull but then lost it once more when a comrade had gone missing with it.

Nkenoess di Milerlo was this comrade. Driven half-mad by the terror of the fearsome beasts of the jungle and fearing for his family if he didn't return with the skull, he tethered the skull to his head with a rope and had done the one thing that made less sense than scattering in the situation; he called upon Roilenkar who he believed he was descended from and jumped onto the side of the beast clinging desperately to it as it rushed off and tried to shake him off.

If one believes Nkenoess' tale he held on to the fearsome creature for 14 days and nights until the beast grew used to him and he was able to escape back to the city as the beast rested.

This was, of course, largely a fiction, but the skull had taken on a heroic quality and the legend was that whoever had this skull strapped to their person would be granted the strength to hold on to almost anything to the point that there arms would be torn off before they let go if they wished.
