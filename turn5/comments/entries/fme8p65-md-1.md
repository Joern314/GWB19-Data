Mair was aware of the Comet's Fall, and its effects upon Mortals.

The Comet's Power was a piece of Mair's, long lost above the world. Thus, they felt some responsibility for the destruction. Mair empowered a Prophet to speak and act upon their Behalf, and set them to the task of gathering a small party of Warriors for a great journey. They were to travel on a great Quest. 

Those who departed would be unlikely to return in this life... but they would earn immortality in the Legends they created as they fought Dire Beasts across the sea. Mair even foretold that those Legends would return to Amlah.

[-3 Acts to create a Prophet]

[They're bringing around ten members of the Order of War, and fifty lesser warriors. The Lesser Warriors are mostly here to be hype-men, those ten are *terrifying*.]

[-2 Acts for some Divine Help along the way, since crossing Continents can be *difficult* at our tech level.]
