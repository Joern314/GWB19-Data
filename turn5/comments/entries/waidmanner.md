Warriors serving as the armed wing of Order of Iron Judges to enforce the law and as agents to the demigod Ferus, the Waidmänner receive their power by being chosen to serve by the Iron Judges or Ferus. The Waidmänner are gifted the abilities to be deadly hunters and warriors to boot.

- Hunting Intuition: The Waidmann possesses extraordinary instincts, allowing them supernatural tracking abilities and more accurate senses. Their senses are in fact so sharp: If they can see, hear, smell or in any other way perceive their target, they can deduce knowledge about their target like is the target human, what age, injuries and weakness to exploit, is the target hostile or a danger.

- Stealth Tactics: The Waidmann is very knowledgeable in stealth and hunting tactics and master them to perfection. Beyond that someone guilty of breaking the Iron Law has a harder time detecting the Waidmann, to aid in the offenders apprehension or to more easily serve justice. 

- Weaponsmastery: The Waidmann is a master in the use of their hunting implements. It doesn't matter if bow, cannon, spear or knife. The Waidmann knows instinctively how to use whatever tool is at hand to capture or incapacitate his chosen prey.

- Trophies: Any Waidmann can perform this hunting ritual. In which he has to slay prey shown to him in a vision. The Hunt has to be undertaken without resources or any form of supernatural or divine powers and only things or powers acquired during the quest can be used for the hunt. If the quest is completed successfully the Waidmann gains some of the power of his prey. This effect is accumulative.

So an experienced Waidmann, who has gone though the ritual several times, will have a number of powers like night vision, or the enhanced senses and strength of an animal, or things as straightforward as retractable claws. Any new cycle however will be more difficult than the last.
