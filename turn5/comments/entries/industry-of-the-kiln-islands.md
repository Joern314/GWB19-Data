# Industry of the Kiln Islands [None]

Since their settlement, the population of the Kiln Islands is primarily Apokryphe of various tribes, with but a handful of humans who are regarded as second class, lacking the greater lifespans and markings of the Apokryphe.        

Said markings become more crucial with the birth of reading, and a few Priests are taught in and skilled at reading the life-markings of their fellow Apokryphs, granting them a particular caste based upon their experiences and skills. However, such Priests are few in number and highly skilled, and as the practice spread, those who assigned to a particular caste were looked down on compared to those dedicated to a trade, and so demand grew even greater.     

In the face of the entire peoples of the island wishing to be read, the Priests deemed that one had to bring a sacrifice to a Reader to buy their services and help to fuel their magic and only those who had seen twenty five winters could do so. Younger frauds were found out and cast out for wasting their time, and soon it came to be that the closer and wealthier populations of the islands could afford the priests time. The outlying islands tend to wait ten years at a time for a wandering priest to sail out to read their lives, or conduct pilgrimages to the larger settlements after they turn of age.

Three primary cities grow throughout the Kiln Islands and the Echoing Jungle, all centred on trade. Following the collapse of the great bridge, Apokryphs began to experiment more with buoyant travel, managing to create small ships from the hollowed caps of gigantic mushrooms, and then larger ships which are combinations of carved caps and timber, around numerous sails which they richly decorate and allow trade between the islands and mainland.     

At the mouth of the Bakwagalis River, the city of **Bakraftel** grew, built on trading up river to the tribes in the Jungle and Hunting Grounds, and was one of the most multicultural cities, with humans and even Yashool visiting and sometimes staying.     
On the northern cape of the Echoing Jungle, the town of **Nisardel** grew on ocean fishing and trade with the islands, the land of the Jungle cut down and stripped away to become farmland, the great timbers used for solid houses and great ships.        

The central volcanic island of the Kiln Islands was dedicated as a place of metalworking and mining, and so the city there became known as **Lyvkerel**, a centre of industry and progress. It was here that Lyva revealed herself to the Apokyph miner Erum on the day of Silent Night, and shared that she had broken the curses encircling the world. She also granted them a holy place within the mines, a volcanic chamber built to channel the volcanoes heat into an intense forge while protecting mortals, and bound any magic spilled in it into the metal being worked. This place became known as a Kiln Forge and the superior metal goods from it, and inspiration, gathered more and more Apokryphs to support Lyvkerel.     

The majority of the islands inhabitants are miners, fishermen or farmers dealing with mushrooms and livestock in the fields and villages around the city, but thanks to being able to forge iron weaponry they are well protected, and Unliving are rarely a problem on the island. 
As the Kiln Islands are home to the glowing metal Kindlscal, they are also able to work this and create glowing weapons, jewellery and ornaments, which they trade together with their ironwork to the mainland and other islands in exchange for meat, non mushroom related food, gemstones and the crafts of other peoples.
