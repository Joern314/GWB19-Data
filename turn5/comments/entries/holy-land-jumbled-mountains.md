# Holy Land â€“ Jumbled Mountains [None]

To start with Glypha gave the jumbled a mountain home. She sculpted mountains from many different kinds of stone, with many, many caves for the jumbled to ornament and build upon, with streams of clear water.

Then she covered the mountainsides with a dense canopy of trees and further up lush grass meadows the jumbled could use to herd goats. Last she put birds and animals of all kind on the mountain, but most importantly goats.

It was her will that this mountainous home was to be retained a place free of polution and servitude like the cities shaped up to be and that the jumbled themselves would live simple and nature bound lives in these lands.
