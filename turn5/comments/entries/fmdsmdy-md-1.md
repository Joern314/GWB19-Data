**The Mindburn spell**

As the Vazari experimented with their mental ability to dominate others, they found that, if magic was used to amplify their attempt at domination, it could not only dominate a person, but burn out any personal memories that the target possessed while leaving the majority of what made them useful, such as the knowledge of how to craft things or what type of foods where toxic, while leaving them unable to remember who even their closest friends or family.

The Vazari turned to using this spell as a way to punish their more heinous criminals whose skills were valuable or rare, enough so that consigning them to unliving status outweighed the benefit of imposing more lethal punishments. In effect this spell could only be used legally after a fair trial was conducted by the judging of their peers and after the ritual was completed, the criminal was treated as a reborn person, given a new name and adopted or auctioned off into a family or other tribe that desired their skills so that the victims of the crimes would not have to deal with seeing the perpetrator day in and day out.
