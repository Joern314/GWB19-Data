# the monopolization of the mari flower [None]

As the city of Raha’stal grew so too did it’s control of the farming and distributing  oh the mari flower  which only grew with in the prismatic plains, the used this to create a monopoly upon the once plentiful resource 

With this monopoly They began trade  with other tribes of the areas of the hero mountains and the prismatic plains. The city  attempting to find a trade route through the mountains hoping that if they could the could pedal there sacred plant to the rest of the world

[dont really have many to trade with beside myself... kinda isolated at the moment]
