For the riders with their herds, grassland is much needed.  
Without the herds, they starve, without grassland, the herd will starve.

Naturally, there are many tribes and they all need the land.  
While the blood plains are large, the tribes get territorial very quickly.

It does not take long for them to bring conflict to each other.  
Battles between tribes becomes a common thing, the people also approve of this, after all, strength is the most important thing. If you are to weak to hold on to a bit of land, you will lose it to someone stronger.

This constant fighting between the tribes does also strengthen the blood riders as a whole.
