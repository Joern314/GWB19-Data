Over three generations of skilled blacksmiths one after the other discord first the secrets of Basic Metalworking (-3) causing the population to mine the lands of the mountains more and more , his son learned how to create  Shaped Weapons(- 3). And finally his granddaughter went on to discover how to create Shaped Armour(-3)

And soon the city once again began to have and produce an adequate amount of weapons. So they law of merit was disbanded  and life over eighty years returned to. Normalcy for the city
