# Against the Grain/ Herding the Masses [None]

The Hunting Grounds were not like any other nation about to develop or any other city-state for that matter. The human tribes of the great forest followed the Iron Law of Rictus, so their tribes were led by the Iron Judges and lived semi-nomadic lives in the great forest, herding small animals like goats and hunting game, while foraging the woods for whatever else they needed.

At the center of the Hunting Grounds however was Sanctuary, the capital, or if you could call it such. Here the traders from foreign cities and tribes came to barter or for cultic purposes like the hunting reituals and sacrifices in honor of Rictus. The Iron Judges tended to greater scale legal matters and hunting grounds and pastures were divied up between tribes.
