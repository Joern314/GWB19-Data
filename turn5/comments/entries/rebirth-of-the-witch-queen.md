# The Rebirth of the Witch-Queen [None]

[After her encounter with Lyva](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fsee67/endless_pantheon_turn_4/fm8j91d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), Oryllia had felt the full weight of guilt, sitting upon her flaming form. She had lost a connection, and Lyva was right. *She was a contradiction. She was untrustworthy.*

As she gazed down into the violet sludge that birthed her, her cursed reflection stared back. It was the forge.

Enough was enough for the Witch-Queen. Why did she need to bring pain upon those she met? It didn't make sense. To curse others needlessly felt horrendous. And she lost Lyva, a friend, for it.

Oryllia took the hammer that Lyva gifted, the blessed silver hammer, and slammed it into the forge's sludge. It writhed and screamed with an unsettling howl, but she wasn't done. Swing after swing, the holy hammer drove into the cursed primordial flesh, melting through it. Blood splattered into her flaming form, whose violet flames has begun to start glowing a faint hint of blue.

It was only until the sludge was nothing but a couple of small strips of sludge that Oryllia stopped. Her shape now blazed with a gentle azure flame, and the metallic plates shimmered like silver.

"*No more contracts. No more wordplay.*"
