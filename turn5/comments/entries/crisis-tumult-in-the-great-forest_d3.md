# Crisis: Tumult in the Great Forest [None]

Malaphet observed the dire beasts that rampaged through the woods and he felt an almost sympathy for their hungry rampage, similar to himself when he was in a hunger-crazed rampage, and so he gave the beasts a gift to help them sate their hunger.

He allowed them to deceive the minds of their prey, making them hear things, or ignore sounds they would normally pay attention too.

Some mortals that survived these assaults took heed of the old tales of a great horror that had once devoured an entire Empire and legends said could manipulate the mind and that came from the stars, matching the tales with the events before them the people began to whisper that perhaps the great horror was the cause of this crisis, feeling out the defenses of the world before resuming it's assault.
