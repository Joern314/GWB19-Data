[ /u/hpllamacrft /u/downsmi1 /u/writinginfinity turn 5 has started, see context ]

[ It is a macro turn. Roleplaying happens in the turn 4 thread, which is still open. Worldbuilding happens in this thread though, and should be the focus of the current turn. That's why everybody got so many acts (10 acts on the hand, and 10 more acts available through prompts ]

[ If you are in the Great Forest of the 1st continent, i also recommend doing something about the Dire Beasts (there can be roleplaying involved in that one ]
