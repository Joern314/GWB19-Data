# The Miracle Crystal [None]

The people of Thyval found a mysterious white crystalline material within their mines, unlike anything else. It was nearly impenetrable, and could only be removed with the use of immense heat. Such a resource was perfect for armor and weapons. It could hold an edge for a long time, and it would rarely bend or break. And the people named it "Malaphine", named after the night sky, as it sparkled like it bore stars. The Rejecters immediately took up Malaphine to equip their Cleric-Knights with weapons from such material, later named the Holy Order of the Starlit Saint.

Resource - Malaphine

A crystalline material most useful in weapons and armor, but also usable in construction. It is very balanced in strength and give.
