# Local Goods to Trade [None]

Among the magics the Sorcerer taught to his people were three enchantments, which could either be used on living things or objects. In each case some aspect of its wearer would be enhanced. The enchantments had to be regularly recharged by filling them with magical energies by killing something and feeding the magic to the enchantment. But in these early days of civilization the magics of the Apokryphs served to produce superior goods and make life easier for the citizens of Epoidos and those who traded with them.
