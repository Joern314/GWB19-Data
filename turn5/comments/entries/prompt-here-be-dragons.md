# Prompt: Here Be Dragons [None]

The Blood Riders are not very interested in land beyond what they themselves can see.

They know of the blood plains they call home, the distant forest, some tell tales of a jungle beyond it.  
tales of places cursed by some gods. it does not help that some tribes do not tell other tribes some things, as they often fight among each other as well.

The Blood riders ride across the plains and see what they can see. Tales of dangerous creatures are usually accepted as truth, even if they might be a bit exaggerated.
