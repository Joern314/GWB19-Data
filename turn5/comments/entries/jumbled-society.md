In accordance with the commands of their goddes the Jumbled try to live rather simple lives. They herd goats on their mountains, forage the woods below and with the improved technical skills in shaping stone and working with tools given to them by Glypha they make the caves of the Jumbled Mountains their home.

To outsiders they often trade their skills in knitting flesh to flesh and replacing limbs. With the outside world they primarily trade corpses and body parts needed for their own reproduction.
