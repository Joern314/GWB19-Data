###Here be Dragons     

As the Apokryphs of the Kiln sailed further afield, they pieced together reports of currents and discovered most of the continent of Primus, trading with the people of the Jungle, the Hunting Ground and the Prismatic Plains.     

Beyond there to the south they believed that the blood plains stretched on into eternity, a remnant of the ancient Ras Empire which had terrorised and ruled over the world thousands of years ago. It was believed that the world lay in a great bowl, and the Empire had found their way to the walls.     

North, east and west, sailing was too difficult for them to reach farther afield, and they attributed such to the curve of the bowl making it impossible to sail uphill, and the great trench was a seam within the boal, a crack to the outside which drained the water to outside, created to allow the Knave to steal the water away.
