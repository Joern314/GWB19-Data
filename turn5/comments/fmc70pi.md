###Jumbled Mountains

A curious chain of mountains hewns from very different kinds of rock giving it a very mixed appearance color wise. Different peaks are made from different colors.

The mountains are filled with caves. There are many streams running down the mountain and many pastures for the very common goats the inhabitants herd.

The foot is packed with dense forests and its typical flora and fauna.

###Knitting Flesh

Among mortals only the jumbled can make use of the powers this metaphysic bestows. It allows a jumbled to take body parts cut off of another person or corpse and sew them together. A living person can so be given use of a replacement limb if they lost their own.

If a jumbled sews together a roughly humanoid form from corpse or body parts the resulting body comes alive as a jumbled themself. The jumbled live a relatively normal mortal life with a normal life span, the only caveat being they can only reproduce by knitting together a new jumbled. Biologically these new jumbled can however perform any other task a normal human, goblin or whater flesh was used in their creation, can. (Even sex.)

###Jumbled-Society

In accordance with the commands of their goddes the Jumbled try to live rather simple lives. They herd goats on their mountains, forage the woods below and with the improved technical skills in shaping stone and working with tools given to them by Glypha they make the caves of the Jumbled Mountains their home.

To outsiders they often trade their skills in knitting flesh to flesh and replacing limbs. With the outside world they primarily trade corpses and body parts needed for their own reproduction.
