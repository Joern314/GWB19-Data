Lyva watched over the madness in the great forest glumly. This was what happened when there wasn't a serpent guarding the atmosphere. Did she have to do everything herself?    

She gathered up several of the shards of crystal, and with them, forged a new spear, an enchanted weapon, the **HeartTaker**, which would channel any magic from its cuts, or from mutated animals, to heal and energise its wielder.    

She also whispered to the great mutants, claiming they were still weak and small, barely the size of her claws as a great dragon. If they wanted to grow great and strong, they would have to eat greater prey, the biggest they could find, and so several of the mutated creatures turned on one another in maddened greed, injuring themselves in the resulting blast.
