#Recovery B: "Against the Grain"

The **Blood Riders** watched the people construct cities, of wood and stone, of how they weakly cowered and hide away. How they prayed for good harvest to feed themselves instead of killing the beast or gathering in the fruits of the land.

They were pathetic.

So the Blood Riders rode out, they fought against those crude cities with their crude weapons.  
And when they needed strength, that is what they got.

They would drink the blood of strong warriors and animals, drink deep in rituals and emerge stronger than before. They rode out to show true strength to the weak of the world.  
The Red God showed them this, the Red God showed them strength

They had trained and breed their horses to be unparalleled to others, none shall match their strength on the great plains.

#Blood Empowerment  
By killing a creature, be it man or beast, one can then drink it's blood in a magical ritual to gain it's power.  
While only a small amount of power is gained, it is permanent and can be repeated.
