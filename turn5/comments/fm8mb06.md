The Sorcerer's mortal body died to the ravages of age. Returned to godhood he looked over the world. 

###Recovery A: Herding the Masses

To his personal enjoyment the city of Epoidos had grown, but it had a long way to go. To facilitate the growth and attract people he had to show mortals learning magic was useful and cantrips everyone could learn with ease was the best  advertisment he could think of and thus the art of Theurgy, the power to channel magical energies in an imitation of power similar to divine spheres into low powered spells for general use. 

Through his prophet the Theos Aner, the Sorcerer taught the people of Epoidos. And from there the news of the magical knowledge of the Great City spread.

###Here Be Dragons

The knowledge of the people of Epoidos was not only limited to that of magic. But it surely made magic more mundane. So the stories the Apokryphs told each other were lands where tasks were not accomplished by the power of the Apokryphs innate magic or magic taught by the Sorcerer, but by fantastical beasts and self-moving machines powered not by magic but by unseen forces of nature or demons. Other stories told of lands cursed by Oryllia so no one could live there except maybe the Unliving.

###Local Goods to Trade

Among the magics the Sorcerer taught to his people were three enchantments, which could either be used on living things or objects. In each case some aspect of its wearer would be enhanced. The enchantments had to be regularly recharged by filling them with magical energies by killing something and feeding the magic to the enchantment. But in these early days of civilization the magics of the Apokryphs served to produce superior goods and make life easier for the citizens of Epoidos and those who traded with them.

###"The Tragedy of the Commons"

As Epoidos was a highly magic dependent society and its people used magic to make their every day lives easier, the primary resource beside wood, stone, leather etc were living animals. There could never be enough living animals to fuel the enchantments and spells used so commonly by the castes of Apokryph citizens to produce their wares. In the end the caste of philosophers had to allocate living animals to artisans, workers etc in order of priority.
