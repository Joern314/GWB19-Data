#The City on the Well

The Worshipers of Mair have built a pale reflection of the Temple of Life, and they have begun to build a city around it. This City's Name is Gwanyin. Immigrants were initially drawn to the City by the promise of Life Essence. They were made to stay within the city by the easy access to life-saving Essence, and the comforts born of the City's rapidly advancing technology.

###The Essence Economy
Just as the City is physically centered on the Well of Life, its Economy is similarly centered upon the Life Essence drawn from the Well.

The Well is sheltered in the Temple of Life, a Fortress-Temple dedicated to Mair. It is a Sacred Place to the Men of Dernas, and the center of their City-State's Governance. It is a place of Healing, of Stockpiling Food against famine, and the last line of defense against those who seek to conquer The Well of Life. The Temple of Life is home to *two* Holy Orders. 

> **The Orders of the Temple**
>
> The Order of Life is the Peaceful side of the Temple. The Order's most important duty is drawing Life Essence from the Well of Life. They administer the Essence to the Sick and Wounded of Dernas, and they throw the bodies of those about to die *into* the well to avoid the rise of Deathless. Their least public, but most *significant*, duty is as the City's Administrative Class. They maintain the city's genealogical records, sign off on work orders, and see to it that the city's craftsmen and laborers are supplied with raw materials.
>
> The Order of War is a brotherhood of Warriors, the finest in Amalah. There are rarely more than fifty members of the Order living within the Temple at any given time. They are given a cup of Life Essence to drink every morning. They then spend the majority of their day *training* for war. Their Training Routine is intense enough that it would kill any mortal man, and includes sparring with sharpened weapons and *barely* pulling strikes. The Order's daily dosage of Life Essence allows their bodies to push through the agonizing trials, and recover in time to do it again the next day. They are known for their *calmness* in battle, for their training has rid them of the fear of death and pain. They battle in silence, calmly and efficiently slaughtering their enemies.

The Order of Life trades with the City-State's Farmers and Tribal Hunters, exchanging Life Essence for food. They also trade the Essence for other resources, such as raw metals and timber, necessary to fuel the city's construction, expansion, and maintenance. A vial of the Essence can be the difference between life and death for a hunter, for it can allow the body to recover from otherwise deadly wounds. It is even more valuable to a Farmer, who can sprinkle the Essence upon their fields and multiply their crop four-fold.

The City's Residents, Specialists and Laborers alike, are cared for by the Temple. Their Food and Supplies are procured by the Temple, secured in Warehouses and allocated in accordance with the Priests' Holy Wisdom. The city is kept in a steady state of expansion. New Housing, Workshops, Warehouses, and *Walls* are constantly being constructed.

The City's Purpose is to hold the Well of Life, and as such the City's Industry is focused upon fueling its war machine. Making advancements in Metallurgy and Craftsmanship win men a place in Song and *Legend* as surely as martial prowess, and Smiths and Bowyers are second only to Warriors in prestige. Architects and Engineers are the next most prestigious professions, for their minds give birth to new fortifications, massive weapons, and other defenses for the Well of Life. 

###Civil Defense
All men and women who live within the walls of Gwanyin are trained in the Basic Arts of War. 

The City supplies each person with a Spear, a Shield, a bow, and basic armor. Craftsmen and other wealthy individuals are expected to outfit themselves in more exceptional equipment. Professional Soldiers are selected from members of the Labor Class who show exceptional aptitude at War, and Officers are promoted form their ranks. Professional Soldiers are given equipment suited to their role, and spend their peace-time as a Guard-Force within the city.

Everyone old enough to train is expected, and scheduled, to report to one of the City's Mustering Grounds once a week. These Courtyards are located next to the Temple of Life, and they are large enough for a force of men to practice moving in formation, combat in formation, and then split off for one-on-one sparring. The practice is overseen by a member of the Order of War, who is enjoying a day off from *their* training to spread their wisdom to lesser warriors.

In the event of the City coming under attack, every man and woman within its walls is capable of joining the defense. Only Artisans, such as Blacksmiths and Architects, are expected to remain off the walls in such an event. Their *knowledge* and skill is seen as too valuable to risk in battle.

###Subject Villages

Gwanyin is not the only settlement in the Silroin Caldera. It has many smaller neighbors, a series of Farming Villages. The City holds sway over these Villages through its two great resources: Life Essence and Warriors.

The City is dependent upon the Villages for food, and it protects them *fiercely*. Any invading force that seeks to raid a Caldera Village is inviting vengeance from Gwanyin. When word of an attack reaches the City, a force of well-trained and well-disciplined soldiers will inevitably be dispatched... generally with a party of five members of the Order of War attached to them.

Likewise, the Villages are dependent upon Gwanyin for the Life Essence. Mixing Life-Essence into the water that irrigates their crops is the *foundation* of the Villagers' rampant success. They trade roughly a quarter of their crop at harvest time, and in exchange the Order of Life will supply them with Life Essence in the Spring. This ensures that their crops are bountiful, allowing them to trade freely with tribes wise enough to *trade* rather than *raid*. 

###The Roads to Gwanyin

Gwanyin's Weakness was also one of its defensive strengths. It was nestled in a Volcanic Caldera... at the top of a very tall Mountian. There were only a handful of roads that could lead a man to the Silroin Caldera, and the City of Gwanyin at its center. Most of them were ancient affairs, unpaved but still *relatively* passable, which circled the mountain's edges and cut through natural caverns on their way up into the caldera. The rest were natural paths. 

This posed a slight *problem* as commerce began to flow up the sides of the mountain. Wear and tear on the paths had caused them to *degrade* over time. If nothing was done, the roads would eventually turn to rubble... and passage would be restricted to the natural paths. Those would grow congested, and in time they would wear away... and rock-slides and avalanches would become serious problems. Repairing and reinforcing the roads was a colossal task for the people of Gwanyin... but it became a priority.

In the meantime, something had to be done to keep the roads open. The solution... was a rough one. Travel up and down the mountain was heavily controlled. The Order of Life's Bureaucrat-Priests worked to figure out *who* should walk *which* road to reach Gwanyin. They took careful accounting of the *weight* of those who traveled, and tried to do their best to send them on paths that could bear them.

The Systems they developed would remain even after the roads were repaired... and would be used to limit damage to the roads and keep the maintenance budget under control.
