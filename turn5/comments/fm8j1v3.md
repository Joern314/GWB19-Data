**Here Be Dragons**

The Nkarlen, having a very large population have spread far and wide across the plains of Gbigolind (Ireland), the green plains and rolling hills. With the advent of mapping, they have charted the extents of the land around the inland sea, Nkirbaal, the extent of the Shattered Mountains, and some of the savage jungles in the south. Amalah, surrounded by its high mountains have yet to be properly mapped, but rumors abound of another race of mortals there and myths of the wealth of an old empire to plunder drive groups of goblins to attempt to cross into the lands beyond frequently.

The savage jungles to the south are considered important lands to the Sodemon tribe, who worship Sunda and the wild lands. Many expeditions have traveled there only to be consumed by savage creatures. Yet the draw of the exotic skins that can be harvested and potential for domesticating the animals draws ever more goblins there.

New goblin settlements spring up all over the second continent; Mukzek on the edge of the inland sea halfway between Nkan'gbamo and Amalah, Sralenkloon on the Northern tip of Gbigolind (Ireland), Lakzekond in the caves at the eastern ends of the shattered mountains, and a rough settlement on the water south of the Nkarlen mountain, called Googebi, just barely carved out of the jungles.

**Local Goods to Trade**

The goblin minors had long been at work in the roots of the shattered mountains and had unearthed many countless gems. With such a head start into the materials the goblins began to cut and shape these gems into finer and finer pieces. These became a huge source of commerce for the two original goblin settlements housing the Enkenea and Mogimal tribes. These Gems were traded for exotic skins and feathers from the Sodemon tribe that roamed the surface and hunted animals. Such skins were prized for making strange hats out of. Perhaps out of the influence of Jikzek's description of their god, the goblins considered wearing of hats extremely important and competed to find who could make the most interesting or closest to Gon's feathered hair.

**"Tragedy of the Commons" - Founding of the Misrei**

Nkarlen populations grew so fast that many objects or needs very quickly could become scarce in an area. Fortunately, food wasn't a significant issue thanks to the natural ability of the goblins to eat rocks. The main problem for the population centers of Kzivo'gbamo and Nkloig Sekzil was water. The caves naturally had water filter into them, but, with the exception of the temple caves, which had large underground cisterns/lakes. Not enough water could be brought up to support the population.

As the fight for this resource intensified the miners and gemcutters formed organizations to control the flow of this resource as well as other resources. To avoid coming into conflict with the supposed control of the Ranos and whatever number Jikzek that sat at the head of the religious sect, the Nkarlen formed the basis of what would become known as the Misrei.

The Misrei started out similar to mining companies or guilds of skilled craftsman, but as it became clear that anarchy was spreading, they became increasingly violent and hierarchical. This pushed forward the development technology and they exercised their power and influence to build aqueducts into the shattered mountains that brought water into massive cisterns from the melting snowfall.

Getting access to this water however, came at a cost as the members of that areas Misrei extorted people. Any trade in resources required paying a cut to the level of the Misrei above you and then they gave a cut of their total earnings to those above them and so on. Technically, they were subject to the will of the Jikzek and the Ranos, but in reality they paid them in tithes to look the other way.

**The City of Kzivo'gbamo, the Nkarlen Capital**

Nkarlen settlements needed little help to grow in population; every generation the population almost tripled, but until now most of the young set out to the vast green expanse to the north or dared the hungry carnivores of the southern jungles. Soon, however, many began to stay in the mountains, digging their caves above the temple-caves even larger and more expansive. Here was the center of the goblin world, the place where the young could come to learn the best in gemcutting, the best in building, and in mining techniques. Here also, they could wander about glory of the glittering temple caves of their creator's home, where the Jikzek resided in all splendor as the voice of god. Many came to see his grand feathered hat, passed down from the first Jikzek and constantly added to by each successor.

In the final days of the second Jikzek's  life, he passed on another technique from the feathered god, the way to craft stones into fine shapes and smooth surfaces. This could never match the smoothness of the walls of the temple-caves down below, but soon there stood great columns that held up the ceilings of gathering spaces, courtyards and paths in Kzivo'gbamo that were crafted from fine stone.

Thus many were drawn to work and live in the fine caves, learning the trades to become a stone cutter, a mason, or gem cutter. Soon five separate misrei coexisted in the city, competing for prominence that from time to time would lead to bloodshed. It was the dream of many a young goblin of the rocks to become a part of one of these Misrei and climb the latter into a mansion-cave.
