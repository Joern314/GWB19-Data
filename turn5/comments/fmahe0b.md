# The Great Canyon

Once a foreboding and lifeless scar on the world, The Great Canyon that divided the continent called Primus was now finally healing more then 8000 years after the wound had first been dealt. Moisture was rich here as it was funneled up from the southerly winds before getting trapped between the miles high ridges that made up the walls of the canyon, leading to a thick blanket of ever-present rain clouds covering the sky.

Under these clouds soared a multitude of life, some animals aimlessly drifted in the wind while others soared with wings as long as a man stands tall and everything in between. The plantlife itself clung to the sides of the ridges, some of the largest plants growing upward several kilometers from the base of the canyon to the tallest ridges while the floor of the canyon had a river that ran through the middle towards the sea and was coated in many tall trees, each competing for the limited amount of sun that shines down on the ravine.

Most animal life here flies in one method or another while most plants rely on alternate sources of energy then the sun to supplement their diet
