###"Against the Grain"

Glypha looked over the world. The cities that were growing on it were dirty places. They gobbled up mortals and put them to work as beasts of burden to run on and feed them. As such they were everything the mortals deserved for the way they often treated their dieing and dead.

But it was not the fault of the Unliving and the dead that they were treated thus. So for her experiment with divine power Glypha collected the remains of different mortal species. She failed many times. But in the end her first mortal was ready.

She called him Patchwork. A goblin who had lost his arms and got replacement human arms. He moved around like a little gorilla. Glypha made Patchwork her prophet. She taught Patchwork how to sew body parts together to produce others of his kind.

Then she taught the jumbled about the claustrophobic life in servitude and misery cities represented. Instead she bad them to wander and live life better than the respectless mortals who had created her and tortured their poor dead relatives.

They would however have to procure body parts to make themselves family. To make their lives outside of cities however easier Glypha taught the mortals how to shape stone and work with tools to a degree not often seen in mortals.

###Here Be Dragons

The jumbled have little to no idea of the outside world. They know that cities are dangerous and liable to cause people misery, so they live mostly in small communities in rural areas, calling caves their homes, which they improved living in by virtue of their handiwork skills with stone and tools.

They do however tell many stories of the poor and hapless mortals who went to the cities to find their luck only to be eaten, chewed up and spit out again like Glypha had warned them.

The jumbled also often herd goats and move from cave village to cave village to make their living.

###Local Goods to Trade

For those who can overlook the often hideous and frightening exteriors of the jumbled they are happy to provide their services as masons and craftsmen, as their abilities in this area are second to non. They also offer to take care of any dying people and dispose of the Unliving they become.

The other thing the jumbled can offer are their skills in knitting flesh. Not only can the jumbled create new life by stitching together flesh of the dead, they can also “repair” people by sewing new arms, legs or other limbs to their bodies, if they lost them. They are no healers but if a bear mauled your arm and you need a new one a deal with a jumbled might be what you need to get a new one.

###"The Tragedy of the Commons"

As new jumbled are created by stitching together the bodies of other mortals by knitting flesh to flesh the scarcest resource are always body party to make themselves families. While they try to keep their numbers small enough to manage life moving through the wild herding goats no one likes to be alone. Therefore the jumbled often try to trade for what they need.

###Holy Land – Jumbled Mountains

To start with Glypha gave the jumbled a mountain home. She sculpted mountains from many different kinds of stone, with many, many caves for the jumbled to ornament and build upon, with streams of clear water.

Then she covered the mountainsides with a dense canopy of trees and further up lush grass meadows the jumbled could use to herd goats. Last she put birds and animals of all kind on the mountain, but most importantly goats.

It was her will that this mountainous home was to be retained a place free of polution and servitude like the cities shaped up to be and that the jumbled themselves would live simple and nature bound lives in these lands.
