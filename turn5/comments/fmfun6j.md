Settling Down \[Herding the Masses + Tragedy of the Commons \]

Years had passed, and after his failure to complete the [Great Temple](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fsee67/endless_pantheon_turn_4/fm6rhbq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), the people rejected Shagantar Arslan as their leader, and chose a new leader; Shagantar Koz. Although soft-spoken, Kozâ€™s kindness is not to be interpreted as weakness. A master planner known for his intellect and foresight, Koz has great ambitions for his people. Thool had created a home for them, and it was up to the Shagan Yashool to make it their own; Koz had every intention of doing so.  He is old enough to remember stories of the trek through the forest to the Crater of Thool, and the trauma from the pilgrimage can still be felt. Since settling in Thool's Crater, the forest has only gotten more and more dangerous. Thool watched as the creatures of the forest mutated and became beastly abominations. Koz knew, his people could not survive under these conditions alone for much longer.

Suddenly, the shaman burst into the Shgantar's quarters bearing an urgent message. "Mighty Shagantar Koz, I have recieved an important message from on high" he exclaimed nearly out of breath. "Thool wishes for us to reeconcile with the humans of the Wooxti Tribe from all those years ago. Koz sat and pondered this message with a thousand-yard stare. "Then so be it. Send an emissary bearing gifts and the promise of prosperity. We are nomads no more, this place shall be known as Shagorn, and it shall be our city".

Upon resettling to Shagan, tensions between the Wooxti and Yashool had run high for quite some time. Particularly over the question of food rationing. The Great Forest had become a dangerous place as of late, and each of these tribes decided to fend for themselves as oppossed to cooperate with one another. The Wooxti did not forget the actions of the previous Shagantar. Though they lived in the same area, the Wooxti insisted on hunting their own game seperate from the Shagan. Eventually, the Shagan lagged far behind the Wooxti's abilities, and food began to run scarce for the Shagan.

Somewhere in the forest, Thool heard these calls and watched their people in the crater struggle to go on. Food was scarce and the forest grew more lethal by the day. Thool pondered the problem for a while, taking inspiration from the surrounding nature. Then, an idea came to mind. "That's it!" they said, and set to work. Thool gathered a mortar and pestle and began mashing leaves until they were a liquid. Then, they poured this liquid all over the crater, raining down on the Shagan Yashool. "This should help them solve the problem about food. Now just as they used to be, these trees will need nothing more than light and water to survive".
