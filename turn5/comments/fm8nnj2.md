###Crisis: Tumult in the Great Forest

A call for help reached the city of Epoidos. Something had mutated the beasts of the great forest into what people called dire beasts. From Epoidos many warriors of the caste of Guardians and many hunters of the caste of Citizens ventured out into the world to test their mettle. Among them was the old prophet of the Sorcerer, Theos Aner.

In a bid to test his own magic against the beasts of the wild that had grown in size and power beyond everything mortals thought possible, he wanted to test his god's magic against these beasts. Theos Aner decided to join the hunt for a giant boar near the city of Sanctuary.

The catastrophe had loosed the biggest, most ferocious wild boar imaginable on the countryside. It rampaged throughout the countryside, destroying vineyards and crops, forcing people to take refuge inside walled towns, where they began to starve.

A great party of hunters gathered. And while their prowess was undeniable it was the old Theos Aner who manged to wound the beast first with the gifts of his god. Magic to enhance his weapons and body. 

Some of the other hunters were ashamed to be outdone by an old man, be he the prophet of a god or not. But their attempt to make their shame a secret by killing those present failed against the magics of the Theos Aner, who used the powers of theurgic spells to frighten them into running away forewarned by divining his best course of action the day before.
