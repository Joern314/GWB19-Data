# Against the Grain

The people of the Tadaloa Island Chain, or the Vazari, as they had taken to calling themselves, had too small a population size to create a city, and even if they did, the islands they called home were unable to support a single massive settlement with there technological level anyway. As it was the people needed little protection from the cities currently , isolated as they were by the islands and dangerous tides of the land. Instead the people focused on splitting themselves onto the various islands, ensuring that there was enough food to be found or produced with the rapidly growing populace.

# Here There be Dragons

The Vazari still had some among them that possessed knowledge of the outside world, and they passed this on to the younger children or those who had had much of their original personality stripped away. They knew that somewhere, there was another landmass beyond their home islands, but they did not know how to reach, or what they might encounter between here and there, the eyes of their patron did not match up with those they knew from home. Meanwhile Minaera, the chosen Prophet of their patron could see a dazzling display of Stars, far beyond what any other mortal could see, and she studied them intently every night, searching for new revelations from their Patron.

# Local Goods to Trade

Due to their isolation on the various islands the Vazari quickly became adept at the creation of boats, while they were nowhere near seaworthy at this stage, they certainly could maneuver through the channels and portions of open water between the islands with ease.

# The Tragedy of the Commons

With each Vazari responsible not only for themselves, but also their Unliving thralls, food became a contentious issue. To solve this issue and lay down laws among themselves they convened to create three different levels of society, The first would be the fully mortals, and food would be prioritized to this class, as they were needed to keep the Unliving in line. Next were the Pure Ones, the unliving whom died either due to injuries or sickness but were otherwise physically fit and well maintained who would be given food when it was available and generally kept well treated. The final layer would be the Impure Ones, these were the unliving who had been subjected to the Death of the Self at birth for some physical deformity. The Impure ones were the first to be sacrificed for magical rituals or used for more dangerous jobs.
