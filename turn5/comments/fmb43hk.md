#Prompt: Here Be Dragons

The Blood Riders are not very interested in land beyond what they themselves can see.

They know of the blood plains they call home, the distant forest, some tell tales of a jungle beyond it.  
tales of places cursed by some gods. it does not help that some tribes do not tell other tribes some things, as they often fight among each other as well.

The Blood riders ride across the plains and see what they can see. Tales of dangerous creatures are usually accepted as truth, even if they might be a bit exaggerated.

#Prompt: Local Goods to Trade

Among the plains, there is a great thing that gallop around. Horses.  
And the blood riders have breed their horses to be the best in the plains and beyond.

For the riders, a good horse is important, and such, obtaining one from a rider is mighty difficult, as they rather not do trade, they rather steal and raid instead.

#Prompt: "The Tragedy of the Commons"

For the riders with their herds, grassland is much needed.  
Without the herds, they starve, without grassland, the herd will starve.

Naturally, there are many tribes and they all need the land.  
While the blood plains are large, the tribes get territorial very quickly.

It does not take long for them to bring conflict to each other.  
Battles between tribes becomes a common thing, the people also approve of this, after all, strength is the most important thing. If you are to weak to hold on to a bit of land, you will lose it to someone stronger.

This constant fighting between the tribes does also strengthen the blood riders as a whole.
