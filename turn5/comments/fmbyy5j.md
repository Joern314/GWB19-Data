###Against the Grain/ Herding the Masses

The Hunting Grounds were not like any other nation about to develop or any other city-state for that matter. The human tribes of the great forest followed the Iron Law of Rictus, so their tribes were led by the Iron Judges and lived semi-nomadic lives in the great forest, herding small animals like goats and hunting game, while foraging the woods for whatever else they needed.

At the center of the Hunting Grounds however was Sanctuary, the capital, or if you could call it such. Here the traders from foreign cities and tribes came to barter or for cultic purposes like the hunting reituals and sacrifices in honor of Rictus. The Iron Judges tended to greater scale legal matters and hunting grounds and pastures were divied up between tribes.

###Here Be Dragons

The people did not know all too much about the world beyond the forest. Only what traders told them of foreign nations and their riches and woes. However the blood riders of Azrakal were an ever present danger, as the young learned how to disappear into the woods, how to fire bows and how to scout, track and survive.

In accordance with this Rictus gave the human hunters an array of spells they could use in conjunction with their magical arrows. The Delayed Arrow was shot, froze in place and only took flight a moment later upon which the archer already had slunk away or switches position. The splitting arrow, which could divide and impact as three seperate arrows and the piercing arrow that punched even through the most ferocious beasts and armor.

###Local Goods to Trade

The hunters of the Hunting Grounds had no metals or gems or delicacies beyond the meat they hunted on offer. What they could do however was to offer their services to other cities as hunters or mercenaries. They could procure meat for people who had trouble hunting due to the animals burning upon death or provide able scouts to warn of raids by dire beasts or blood riders. In part this was because of the miracle given to the people of hunting grounds that showed the best among them were the chosen of Rictus, the Waidmänner.

They were given the power to have senses of smell, hearing and sight as sharp as the best predators. And their instincts provided them with additional information about the things they perceived, like age, health, injuries and in rare cases even intent. They could hide like the best stalking predators, often in plain sight. They had instant mastery with all the tools of a hunter, be it knife, bow, arrow or trap. And from the fiercest enemies they slew they could absorb increased powers, like a wild animals stamina or the power to see in the dark

###Tragedy of the Commons

The most scarce of products were those of metal. A good arrowhead was priceless as was a pot, pan or even nail. As such allocation of such products was often decided by the Iron Judges, unless a person had taken such an object of their prey, be it an enemy raider in the hunting grounds or a dire beast stuck with many arrows.
