# Tragedy of the Commons

When Shata returned from the battles in the forest, the city welcomed her and it was unanimously agreed that she be supreme lawgiver of the city and its queen. Shata set down this as year 1. Knowledge of urban planning was revealed to her, and she diverted the Bakwagalis to create transportation canals in the rainy season through the city. This was possible because all buildings were built on earth mounds. 

The diversion of the waters made the harvesting of cichlids easier for the city's residents, and chronic over-fishing had almost exterminated these fish by the year 30. The fishers brought this problem to Queen Shata in a public audience. In all her Black Wing wisdom she asked to see their nets. They had been using nets of fine mesh, with only the tinniest holes for water flow. 

"From now on, all fishnets must have holes big enough for a finch to pass through, that way adolescent fish will escape and continue to reproduce."

This came to pass and soon all things were measured in finches.
