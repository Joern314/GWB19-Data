The Guardian Tree \[Tumult in the Great Forest\]

The Great Forest has become saturated with mutant beasts and horrendous, lethal, abominations. Although the Shagan were now able to survive off of light and water alone, it was becoming more and more dangerous to venture out through the woods to find a sunny clearing. On the other end of things, the Shagan and the Wooxti were still refusing to cooperate, separated by mutual mistrust and an age-old feud with no resolution in sight.

Thool watched this conflict foment, worried about the fate of his people. He knew immediately what it would take to mend this conflict.  Thool returned to the Great Temple and dug up a root from the [Tree of Yashqal](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/fm2attt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), the moment where this conflict started. Thool dropped the seed from the cosmos directly into the center of the crater, and gave it a blessing. This would be her most mighty project since creating the crater.

The tree started to grow and grow, reaching a gargantuan size, bigger than any Yashqal Tree should ever normally grow. Its canopy covered the entirety of the crater's opening, sealing it away from the rest of the Great Forest. The roots penetrated deep into the earth and the water surrounding the cave. These roots acted as a natural filter for both the water and soil, keeping it pure and fertile constantly. Thool would also keep the seasons regulated through this tree, keeping favorable conditions for it to grow and for Shagorn to thrive as a city. At times this city would also be known as Everspring, for the favorable climate that existed in this crater with the Great Tree protecting it.

The leaves of this great tree were enormous, creating dazzling lights as bright as the sun, allowing the Yashool  to feed without need to leave the crater. On the outside facing the jungle, the other side of these leaves was a tough and rugged as any armor that a smith could forge in order to protect against the mutants that roamed the forest. Over time, the Shagan learned to manipulate these leaves into armor and weapons for themselves, a closely guarded secret. This armor would help protect the Shagan when they needed to leave Shagorn, and would be coveted the world over.
