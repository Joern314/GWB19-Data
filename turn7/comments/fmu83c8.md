"You have sssertainly grrrown. Gonna need a biggerrr sssword." A feral growl came from Gon's broad grin, she had yet to show him her form since she had been asleep. He took the lava blade he was holding and drew it across a wound to collect more, increasing it to a ridiculous two hand sized blade.

As she went to pull him off the moon he set the blade on his shoulder and flipped his talons up in an athletic maneuver to clamp on to the thinner part of her tail letting himself be pulled along.

"I do miss flying." he laughed wildly, preparing to hack off part of her tail that was holding onto his arm.
