##Crisis: Like Vermin I

The Blood Riders had no such problem, they used very little magic, praticly speaking only Blood Empowerment. And anytime they killed a deer or horse they got magical blood to use.

The Vengeful however had such a problem.  
They had heavy usage of Blood Empowerment they used meant a lot of sacrifices was needed.

They solve this mostly by killing their goblins slaves, that of course, lead to them needing more slaves.

A slave guild started to appear, these warriors specialized in gathering goblin slaves from all sources they can. Traps, assault and the like.

The Vengeful in their city of Redgash was very damaging, a constant stream of slaves are needed for them.

##The Invisible Silk Roads

One of the blood riders tribes, half way to the forest where the rangers live.  
They were one of the few tribes that were somewhat half-friendly with the forest men.

Sometimes, they even traded with them. Sometimes, a trader comes from them, maybe from land far away to buy their horses.

The tribe had developed a habit of fighting other tribes for their horses to trade them.

They had heard ideas coming from the forest people, the idea of 'law'.  
Most of it was rubbish of course.

But some of them started to adopt a code of honor, the idea of procedure for things.  
Of course, that was only for them, outsiders had no such protection.
