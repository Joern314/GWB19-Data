##the heroes tenets 

Prismari had been growing more and more concerned with the growing divisions and different interpretations of his message in raha’stal ... he wanted people to help people and to change the world.... how could that be so hard to understand.... he figured it had to be the mortals fault... they must be hardwired to like more complex orders... rictus made them after all 

So perhaps even need to come up with a heroes codex of his own and present it to the mortals ! 

He went to work making his best rule for his fallowing around the world... most notably raha’stal 

Prismari created a vision of himself for all mortals to see 

“Mortals and heroes of the world ! I am Prismari and I have noticed some have been interpreting my message incorrectly.... I am here to correct that. So now I shall bestow upon you all the tenets of heroism ” Prismari then explained his news more complex decree 

1. Basic Principle - The heroes and any organization they belong are above borders,nationality or race . Their duty is the peace and safety of the citizenry of the world 
2. Protective Duty (Civilians) - If a civilian's life or freedoms are threatened, a hero or adventurers duty is to ensure their safety.
3. Non-interference (Nations) - Heroes should  have no authority against national entities or organizations recognized and authorized by them
4. The heroes and adventure Have a Duty to the People. In the event of unjust imperilment of citizens, the heroes have  sworn duty is to bear the responsibility for the citizen(s)' safety which supersedes national authorities 

“ try your hardest to adhere to these tenets and you to may one day be a true hero!” Prismari said with a large smile 

The people of raha’stal had the religious debates settled by a god them self, much to the city pleasure as celebration and festivities filled the city for a god had spoken to them. Yet there in a small corner of the city the faction the god didn’t agree with mopped around with a dark cloud hanging over them 

In the coming years most of the city agreed with Prismari new tenets ... and yet a small portion of the population left. They where lead by a greedy man named Melchiah calming Prismari was wrong and he would prove it even if he had to change the world to do it
