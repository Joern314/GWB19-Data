Lyva was rather colourful now, with prismatic crystalline ash scattered across her body, "But I didn't choose this! I didn't even lay her or anything, and she's so squishy she'll die on her own!"    

She flopped down to sit cross legged, lifting the blob up at arms length, "This isn't right, I didn't try and claim any fourth sphere, I didn't let my love create anything recklessly, and if I did desire a child I would have... hmm..."    

Lyva wiped her eyes and stood, hugging the child close, "Can I borrow Metatron, Oryllia? Maybe Malaphet would like her, he's sort of blobby."
