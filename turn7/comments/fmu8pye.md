"Miss it? You're a god, just want to!" Lyva growled, having realised the flaw over her logic. How was she meant to hurt him like this? Biting him would hurt him, sure, but it would feel like something was biting her entirety.      

She considered the matter as she writhed, zig zagging and twirling through the stars, like a rollercoaster, until searing pain came and Gon shot off, burning blade severing her length.     

"ARGH! I JUST REGREW THAT!" The goddess roared over the loss of a minute fraction of her length, then swooped by, molten mane, spines and tiny limbs battering him with momentum.
