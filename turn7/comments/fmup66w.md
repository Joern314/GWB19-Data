“ do you want the long version or the short version.”Prismari asked 

“ that wastes of divine space... is my genetic depositor so to speak... not my family nor my father.” Prismari said with a lot of hate and anger in his voice 

“ I lost Prismari.... before he had a name. He is my son... I saved him from dying in the void.  But I didn’t know how to tell him who o was .... I was ashamed of losing him... ashamed of leaving my family..... and now he and lyva hate me .” Kain said with a said smile
