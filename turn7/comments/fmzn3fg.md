##The Struggle of Idren II

As Idren aged, he learned to sail on the ships from the island and around the shores of the continent, eventually claiming the ship known as **Caermis** as his own when the sailor above him retired. With the caermis and his crew, he sailed throughout the Kiln Islands and around the peninsulas of the Echoing Jungle. He encountered a great leftover Dire Wolf in the Hunting Grounds and lured it into the river while his archers speared it with javelins. He sailed along the coast of the Red Plains and mocked the riders there, robbing those who set to raid his ship.     

It was one of these riders who caught the sailor's interest. When his arm was cut off, he kept fighting. When he was hurt, he kept fighting. When he was speared through, he unfurled wings and set to fly away. When he was harpooned and pulled down to the ground, he kept snarling and seeking to bite and claw at his captors. The creature in the shape of a man would not die. Idren was fascinated to have an immortal as his "guest", and interrogated the man on the source of his healing abilities, torturing him and feeding him mere drips of blood until the Vampire's truth was revealed.     

With the knowledge of the vampire's blessing, Idren burned the creature to ashes and scattered them, before resuming sailing back up the continent, a plan in the making. Spilling vast blood or gaining the favour of an elder Vampire would turn the blessing to him, but the rest of the creatures brood roamed the interior of the plains, far from the shore where Idren was most comfortable. He would have to accrue more men, maybe even an armada in order to enter the plains safely and meet the Elder of the Vampires, or to kill enough to gain it for himself.    

At that time, new metalwork was spreading from Bakraftel, a symbol of trade as small bronze tokens, and so Idren set about trading for as much of these as he did. Yet in the process, rumours of potential sailors, other pickpockets and sort he knew well came that they were showing up missing blood in a familiar pattern. Seeking out fellow thieves and gutter rats, Idren discovered another clan of Vampires nestled in the Echoing Jungle's settlement, preying upon his kind and seducing them. The hunt began anew, as Idren laid traps for their networks, and chased them down in the night, eventually smashing his way in a great house to confront the vampire and demand immortality.    

Given the mess he had made, the denial was perhaps not surprising, and soon battle ensued with the man somehow gaining triumph once more.    

Seven times Idren hunted down vampires demanding their blessing, and Seven times he was rejected and forced to battle, slaying the spawned fiends with his men. 

Clearly their supposed immortality was lacking, and soon the sailor left the shores of the echoing jungle, the story and legend of his deeds, of hunting down these predators, echoing through towns and cities. Though the man himself slowly aged as he wandered far and wide seeking power, the stories and legends of his deeds remained spoken of over and over, becoming something more, something that would never be forgotten.
