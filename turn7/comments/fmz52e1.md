The Vengeful had been moving toward Amalah and eventually, they could see it.

Great walls that once they called home.  
Almost peaceful to look at, they have no idea what is coming at them.

##First Strike  
(Attackers: 6 - Defenders: 10)

Derak orders his forces to charge the wall, to get over it at any cost. The Dinosaur beasts are being held back, empowered by runes they might be but they are far to large to climb a wall.  
The Defenses of Amalah was however true to it's words, despite suffering a surprise attack, the defenders remained calm and quickly sounded alarms.  
Ladders were put up almost as soon as they were pushed down, a ram was slammed on to it's gates but they were constantly pelted with arrows.  

Soon, all the walls were covered in archers, defenders armed with sword and shields standing to push down assaults on the walls.

No mater how many times they attempted to take the walls or the gate, they were stopped. The Defenders manage to secure many of their injured back to be healed, suffering minor losses only.  
Soon, the attackers called off the assault for the day, this would take time.

##Wall Break
(Attackers : 9 - Defenders: 7)

A new strategy would be demanded, Derak summoned his vampire champions and gave them their new tasks.  

As morning dawned, a new assault began. The Defenders believed this would just be a repeat of the the day before but that is when they were struck from behind.  
Vampires, flying vampires, they flew high and then descended on the walls, being far more powerful than any mortal, they killed, almost flew around the walls, killing but a few to allow the unliving to strike back at their ones allies in life.  
The walls were in chaos. Aerial assaults were unheard of, only birds flew as far as most men knew.  
A few tried to fight these vampires, but even if they got in a deadly wound on them by shear luck, the vampires simply laughed and cut them down instead.

Using this chaos, the rams struck back at it's gates, even using a trained giant lizard creature to pound the gates down.

And when the gates fell, the Vengeful army poured though it.  
Powered by blood, and might giant beasts charging at the defenders, it was clear this breach could not be retaken.  
Now, a urban fight had begun.

##Bleeding Battles
(Attackers: 8 - Defenders: 8)

The city defenses were of course, a masterful art by the defenders.  
While the Vengeful owned the streets with their powerful champions, the vampires and mighty war beasts, the inside of buildings and alleyways were a different mater.

Whenever the Vengeful believed to have secured a street or district, new defenders would emerge to attack them.

The Order of war also shined during this time, now concentrated instead of spread out, they took the fight to the vampires.  
Even if a single vampire was far stronger than anyone of them could ever hope, for every vampire, there must have been at least 3 soldiers of the order. By coordinating their strikes on them, they could injure them enough to bring them down on the ground, or force their retreat.

The battle of the districts was a long and painful process, both attackers and defenders bleeding dry.

Eventually, Derak was forced to sound the horn of retreat, falling back outside the walls after setting fire to many buildings to prevent pursuit.
