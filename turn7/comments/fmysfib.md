 

Purely Mortal Struggle II: Ixto uses blood magic, grows her legend, and of course shows fidelity to the titan bearcat. 

Ixto became a member of the Calitsh governor’s personal guard, but still her ambition grew. She practiced the Dance of the Whisker for hours a day; Ixto became stronger than any yashool woman. She began to abstain from cooked food and ate just like the bearcats; Ixto became stronger than any yashool man. Ixto did not hide her strength and would wrestle horses for sport. Her devotion to the Whisker was noted, and by age 25 she was captain of the guard. It was then that she began to experiment with darker magic. 

Ixto refused to sleep in the comfort of the city palace, and would venture into the jungle some nights to sleep like the titan bearcats. She would hunt and feed on the flesh of wild hogs. Some say it was an apokryph that taught her how blood could be applied to make one stronger, some say it was an accident of the hunt. Either way, the legend grew of her rampaging through the jungle at night on a blood high. 

Then, the mild-mannered governor of Chalitsh was recalled to Wooxti-Kwashtol, and King Tavu sent a harsher one in his place. The new governor had heard the stories of Ixto, and regarded her more animal than mortal. Ixto could feel a plot being fabricated, and gathered her guard closer around her, she taught them how to supplement their titanic strength with the power of blood. They confessed that the new governor was planning on arresting her on charges of black magic, Ixto ordered them to comply with all plans to execute her. 

When Ixto was finally arrested, she did not resist. The governor announced the charges and Ixto’s guilt. She was tied down and laid on her chest while the executioner brandished an axe.  The axeman swung, and at the last moment Ixto broke her binds, flipped over, and caught the axe in her teeth. Her guards turned on the governor, and Chalitsh fell to her control. 

With the city under her grasp, Ixto gathered the Society of the Whisker around her and spoke of ostracization of their society. She marched on the capital, and with their enhanced strength, they overpowered the armies of Wooxti-Kwashotl. In 230, Ixto founded the Ixtic dynasty; she dispatched Whisker governors to all corners of the jungle, and established a majority of Whiskers on the Guidance Council of the Holy Island.

Ixto smashed the memorials of Blackwing power. The armies maintained their power with a steady stream of wild hog blood.
