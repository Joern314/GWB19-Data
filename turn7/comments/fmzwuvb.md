"Excuse me, Oryllia?" A weary Gon knocked on Oryllia's door sometime after being blown up by Lyva and Prismari's kid. He had recovered and gotten a something of a handle on how livid he was with the situation. 

For almost his whole life, he had been with her. Forgemother, Serpent friend of the Flayed God, Lover of the Sorcerer, Lover of Prismari, mother of Sunda, and soon to be mother of whatever her new child's name was. He heard the mortals, yes, and there was one thing that was something in common with all these tales; they lacked Gon. 

No invite to the moon congregation where she lived right next to Prismari... it was all starting to add up. The lie had opened his eyes; he had loved her, and still did, but she was playing him for a fool. 

He was nothing to her, a pawn, a tool. A plaything. A joke. *Just like before.*

Oryllia had called him to the situation and had wanted Lyva to take responsibility. She had also been the one in the past who made the land scream in the dark, and he remembered her forge with the substance that could be perhaps greater than the gods.
