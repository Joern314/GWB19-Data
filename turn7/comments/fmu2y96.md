Gon's eyes went wide at the runes around him as he guessed it was something dangerous right before the explosion and crossed his arms in front of him defensively. Already suffering from previous wounds the blast knocked him back leaving pieces of rock crumbling from his scaled arm. The explosion left him with his ears ringing. With a few coughs he stumbled forward to claw at the ice wall and teleported away to somewhere random where he immediately crumpled to the ground, unable to move anymore.
