##Invisible Silk Roads and Blended Heresy     
   
As the metalwork and glowing creations of the Kiln Isles spread, many sails began to curve around the continent of Primus, west, to trade for the herbs and flowers of the Prismatic Plains. As a suitable stopping point, a fishing town called **Kimari** grew on the mouth of a river on the north west of the Plains.     

There, the rough people of the Plains and the Apokryph sailors mingled, and began to share coin and metalwork. There, legends of the Sorcerer and the Forgemother mingled and twisted with the stories of many heroes from the Plains. Soon it was decided that the heroes of life must have honoured seats elsewhere than the Sorcerer's Rift, and so the heroes were believed to join the gods in the Temple of the Moon, which they called **Everreach**. It was assumed that the Forgemother Lyva was responsible for the creation and birth of life, symbolised by forges and crafts, Prismari was scene as the living of this tribunal, and the Sorcerer as Death and rewriting the energies as people perished into magic. Songs were particularly important to this blend of faiths, often with a three motif running through them of nine lines total.     

Lyva was getting quite tired of her image and concept being twisted however. It was one thing to be seen as a goddess of creation, it was another to be called fertility itself and have idols of her sculpted  to be incredibly pregnant or maternal.    

Therefore she reached out in dreams to her faithful, to her shaman-smiths and bloodletters, and reintroduced herself. She was Lyva, she was Metal, Trade, Greed and Creation. She was a lover and she did produce life and forge the world, but she did not call Sunda or any other her chosen son or daughter, any more than she did the Apokryphs. She was humanoid and dragon, she was merchant, trader, creator and goddess, and she condemned wastefulness, destruction and inhibition.     

She gave them rites to work with different gods, songs she remembered fondly, and instructions to take up the new coins in her name as the bronze tokens had her blessing.
