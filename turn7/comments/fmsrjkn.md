The moment the baby was lifted on to Oryllia crown it began screeching and screaming.... and then circles of divine runes surrounded the bodies of  lyva, Oryllia and the baby it self 


Then suddenly a bust of energy... a divine explosion engulfed the three... the little baby with its survival  instinct controlled the explosions to avoid its own body... and by extension Orylliaâ€™s crown 

And then it began screening again almost as if it prepared to do its little attack again if its demands where not met
