# Crisis: Heresy I

Thyval had a crisis of faith. There were disputes among the city about the Beloved Angel, and who she was in relation to the Witch. Some had claimed that they were once sisters, and they fell out after one chose the profane over sanctity. Some claimed that the Angel and the Witch were cosmic enemies, found at the beginning of time, always warring against one another. And, to Oryllia's dismay, some had said that they were one in the same, playing a charade to sap up faith.

Oryllia had a plan.

The High Exalter, the Seers of Sanctity, and many attendees had all witnessed a glorious display within the Pearl Temple. The altar was covered in holy fire, and their incense was lapped up by the very flames of the Angel.

Her ethereally beautiful form caused all to bow before her. Nothing like this ever happened in the many generations of the city's existence.

"My children, you quarrel over foolish things. Turn thine eyes back to me, and your purity shall be restored."

# A Purely Mortal Struggle II

Laeghaill returned to the Order's headquarters, retrieving his arms and armaments. Blood was to be spilled, and the Angel damn him to the Wastes if there was no forgiveness.

He entered into the streets of Thyval, covering himself in rags and hiding among the lower populous. He communed with those desperate of spiritual guidance, helping them and restoring their hope in the Angel, but also used them as means to find those who took his love's life.

When he found them, his sword was thrumming with fury, same as his pendant. Under the cover of night, Laeghaill rode to the edge of the Wastes, with his offenders dragged behind his horse by ropes around their ankles.

Bound by rope and fear, the lowlifes, those cruel traitors, were kicked into a poisonous pool, and Laighaill, with the Angel's assurance of their curses on their souls, still feared over his own. But the Angel's voice, for the first time, rang in his soul.

"Vengeance no more. Pain leave you, Laeghaill. Though accursed, the scales have been tipped. And now, all is right."
