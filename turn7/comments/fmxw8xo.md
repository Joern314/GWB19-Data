Gon was entirely different; as he appeared now he was more of a bipedal man-lizard than anything else. He lacked horns of any sort and instead his raptor-like head was crowned with familiar green and purple feathers that seemed to continue onto his upper back, flowed down his spine and ended in a wider accent at the tip of his tail. His muscled arms now had feathers that came off of the underside of his forearm and his hands and feet now ended in sharp obsidian claws.

The familiar white scars still held their places, appearing to be made out of  quartz and somehow lacking in proper scale coverage, while the rest of his body seemed to be a rather jumbled mix of colors. Spots where he had suffered wounds from the earlier parts of their battle were marked by black stony scales, but the majority of him was a bright green color matching the jade of the moon that he had unconsciously used to heal himself after the explosion. Some spots seemed to be reverting back to the familiar brown color of his usual skin as if they were the parts either undamaged or already fully healed.

Gon's breathing was shallow and ragged and he barely stirred at all as she shook him.

"What'sss that?" He muttered groggily and rubbed his head on the floor from the tickling, before lazily opening one reptilian eye to look back at her, lifting his head slightly but keeping it to one side. After a moment, a large yawn showing off strong sharp teeth seemingly designed for tearing flesh and crushing bone, he started to come to, blinking at he but still barely moving.

"You... blew us up with... sssomething... don't rrrememberrr? Crazzzy girrrl." He rumbled with laughter that turned into a cough.

"On floorrr... becaussse... can't move..." The lizardman replied with a heavy exhale. "Happy you arrre up, love... was worrried... brrrought you to... home. Feeling alrrright?"
