##Like Vermin and Blood      

As Sabin set her routes deep in Bakraftel and the cities of the Echoing Jungle, she created networks of informants and dependants addicted to her blood and goodwill. Unlike those in the south, she kept her mortals alive to feed on them repeatedly and often, choosing the most trustworthy to become her Inheritors and lesser vampires. As they had immortality to spend, it was in their interest to stabilise the region, and so Sabin called on her mistress, the Goddess Lyva to which she was prophet, to help her harness magic better.      

Lyva taught her of a better form of trading, of the use of tokens to manage finances, by which mortals could hold onto their livestock more loosely as their wealth as not solely what they possessed. Through Sabin's contacts, she gathered smiths to produce bronze coins and tokens, and worked to get traders under her thrall to spread them and the system.      

Temples were now merged with butcheries in a sense, places were Apokryph priests would kill any and all livestock to harness the magic from them, before the carcasses were passed on to butchers to carve up the meat and sell on. In these places, faith, magic, food and coin were all exchanged, and Lyva found herself favouring them and urging Sabin to help construct more.
