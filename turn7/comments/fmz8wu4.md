#The Guilds of Gwanyin

[A Purely Mortal Struggle]

Aran spent his life *changing* the Society of Gwanyin.

Aran spent his life *championing* an Idea. Without the Craftsmen who built their weapons and armor, the City's Warriors would be unable to defend it. Thus, it was clear that the Craftsmen were of equal importance to the Warriors as neither could stand for long without the other. Thus, wasn't it only fair that the Craftsmen be granted respect and honors akin to those granted to warriors?

Aran convinced many that the Craftsmen of the City should have Honorable Orders, like the Order of War. The Order of War served a crucial purpose in the development of the City's Warriors. The Champions of the Order *trained* the common soldiers and the levies. They elevated the finest warriors to the Lesser Order of War, so that they could be prepared for the Honor of being elevated to the Order itself. Surely the Craftsmen deserved something similar?

Thus... the Craftsman's Guilds were founded. At first they were simple Social Clubs, places where members of the same Trade could gather to socialize. Familiarity was born from these quiet meetings, and that Familiarity grew into trust. Trust grew into Friendship, and Friendships grew into Alliances. The Guilds' Members began to work together to set standards of quality and *payment* among their members.

Eventually, the Order of Life was forced to recognize the Guilds' Authority over their Trades. This was not wholly a bad thing. The Order of Life was able to offload much of its Bureaucratic Labor onto the Guilds... freeing up the Priest-Bureaucrats for other concerns. This had the *peculiar* effect of significantly decentralizing the Economy... necessitating a standard of trade other than Life Essence.

Metals were the clear candidate for a currency. However, there were serious problems with this approach. It was difficult to establish relative value between the metals, it was even harder to ensure that a lump of metal was pure, and it was relatively common for a merchant to refuse payment in one metal or another.

This problem was resolved by the Guild of Silversmiths. They produced a series of Coins of uniform weight and design, and guaranteed purity. They also setup an exchange rate internally between the metal coins, which they adjusted periodically at regular intervals. This allowed them to implement a functional currency for Gwanyin.
