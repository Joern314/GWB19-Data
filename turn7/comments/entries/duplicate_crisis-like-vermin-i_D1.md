# Crisis: Like Vermin I [None]

The magic was in high demand and stocks of animals were dwindling. Magic was the one thing however the people of Epoidos were best at and that they had to share with the world.

The Inncer Council decided to solve this problem by condemning heretics to death. Using their magical energies to fuel the magic of Epoidos and at the same time reducing those consuming magic in the city.

As the Sorcerer heard their prayers from afar, and detected many souls going to the Rift, he returned and was appalled.

To allow mortals to learn from the past and that and how society had functioned before magic, the Sorcerer in the guise of the Vir Sacra taught the people of Epoidos necromancy. He summoned the spirits of the long dead and had them confirm the worth of hard work in comparison with using magic for every little thing.

And thus the number of magic and spells used in Epoidos receded massively.
