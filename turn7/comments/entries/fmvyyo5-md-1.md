**Heresy Crisis I: The Stone Inquisition**

A rift between factions in the Nkarlen religions threatened to destabilize the faith and breed a civil war in the goblin homelands. 

To control this potential for chaotic anarchy, Gon contacted all of his worshipers, choosing to appear without the clawed hand for the time being. He dictated to them a set of rules, declaring that only the Ranos and the Jikzek that sat on the stone throne had full religious authority and were thereby to enforce these rules. He declared to all of them that those who stray from these rules are to be punished by being sent to work in the deepest and most dangerous mines. Any who inflicted harm in the name of religion on another goblin were to have the same harm done to them three times over as payment.

The portion of the Ranos that managed these operations became known as The Stone Inquisition.

\[-2 contact mortals. Have no idea if this will work at all, but I figured if I condense the violence into organized violence it would be better than complete civil war. It doesn't make sense to me to stop all violence when that's kinda part of the goblin's culture.\]

**Like Vermin Crisis I: The Pits**

The goblins solution to the dwindling supply of unliving creatures to supply magic for their gem weaving and petrification magics, was as brutal as it was efficient. The Nkarlen bred and died at a rate exceeding all other mortals, so the Misrei set up collection services for those who had become unliving or for those nearing death. The would collect up groups of them into deep pits and, using expert slingers, kill them off to fill nearby oxeblas crystals to the max which they then transfer to the mages in straw/grass filled boxes very carefully. They also restricted access to the learning of many of the spells for the lower levels of the Misrei.

This would help counteract the problem of running out of unliving animals and give the Misrei more power. The goblins, made with little sympathy, seemed to consider such actions as a wise use of what would otherwise be a wasted resource.

**Invisible Silk Roads**

While the Nkarlen didn't have ships to properly trade with anyone overseas, they traded fine Gems to both the neighboring jumbled, who they found curious more than anything, and on occasion to merchants of Amalah who would visit the nearest goblin city of Mukzek about halfway between the goblin capital and largest gem production center of Kzivo'gbamo. Here they exchanged gems for the goods of Amalah.

The mixture of cultures, with Amalah having tales of men fighting until they could fight no more becoming stronger. The goblins upon hearing these tales, set up fight pits with battles to the near undeath. It was brutal combat, but unfortunately it didn't work quite the same way as it did in Amalah. The sport lasted however and many fighting competitions drew fairly significant crowds, with some goblins, turning to worship the divine of Amalah. This also lead to betting and a class of goblins warriors that the two Misrei were quick to dominate.

Eventually this restructuring of the Misrei spread leading to the formation of a new rank, the Saldeol, who acted almost like a local militia and the Misrei's enforcers. These were usually promoted from the most vicious or effective and loyal of the lower levels.
