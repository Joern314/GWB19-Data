"It could be dangerous... I won't throw something away if I have no idea what effect it would have if someone else found it. Can you imagine the potential devastation? Besides, what if I need it to remedy the problem?" Gon admitted, still blinking forcefully trying to get godsight to work.

"Natural... natural... so it is a feeling... wait! When I was a demigod Nek and I... Hold on." Gon covered his right eye and tried closing his left eye and focusing again. When he opened it again it was a luminous gold. The effect was immediate and Gon shrugged of Kain's hand.

"Fascinating, so these are what you were talking about I take it." 

Keeping his right eye closed, he gazed at his left arm for a moment until a mad idea struck him. Steadying himself by digging his talons into the ground he decided to see if he could tug on these strands. Twisting them around his arm and grabbing them he gave a mighty tug, which - perhaps surprisingly - seemed to work in a way, as cracks started to appear in his arm. After a moment he let go.

"Gah! That hurt... hrrrm... Had to try..." Gon said shaking off the pain in his arm. He opened his right eye and the gold faded from his left as it returned to its normal green flecked with purple.

"I will speak with this Dawri..." He said after a pause. "... and see if there is someone who can help out. With... whatever that tether is. Thank you for your assistance, Kain."
