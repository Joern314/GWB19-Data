# Invisible Roads between Warring States [None]

Suffice it to say, the Vengeful and the People of Dernas do not trade with each-other directly. There is much bad blood between the states. However, The Life Essence flows to The Vengeful *anyway*. Once The Essence is beyond Dernas's direct influence, it flows along the Trade-Routes like any other commodity. 

Much of the Life Essence that goes to the Vengeful in their Jungle moves through a relatively innocuous small fishing village on the border of the Goblin Lands, known as Freeport. The People of the Village make their living from the sea, but they earn their luxuries from the use of their harbor. Theirs is a safe harbor in dangerous lands... in part because they are followers of the War Gods.

Freeport knows Mair as the God of Life who sends forth the Essence. It knows the Black Lady who reigns over War, Strength, and Suffering. They know the Red God, whose rituals bring them the strength they need to hold firm against the Goblin Hordes.

The People of the Village do not have the Paranoia of Gwanyin. However, they do dedicate themselves to the maintenance of their palisade walls. This is meant to blunt the attack of Goblin Hordes that manage to slip past Freeport's Watchful Sentries. The majority of the Goblins are kept at by by the Free Riders, who hunt Goblins that get too close to the city... and occasionally send Goblin Slaves south to Redgash.

The Village does its best to avoid the ire of Redgash. Its value in keeping the Life Essence flowing might be reason enough for the Vengeful and their Vampire King to leave the settlement alone. Freeport keeps hold of its independence by sending gifts to Redgash every year. They are small gifts, groups of Goblin Slaves and tribute of Essence, but they are meant to appease the Vengeful.

[/u/plintstorm, feel free to describe what trade goods flow back to Gwanyin from your people through these intermediaries.]
