# Kain’s gift [None]


Kain had wanted Prismari and lyva to consider how harsh they where being... he had done wrong sure... but would the two of them take responsibility for what he was about to do 

Upon the volcano of the kiln islands kain was scribing arcane rune upon it rim 

He took out a little vile of a colourful substance he knew as Prismari blood, he also removed a portion of divine potassium once part of lyva tail. Throwing them both in the volcano causing the script to glow 

He then reached in to one of his bag with the wind and remove a second larger bag that was glowing with the intensity of a star and placed it on the ground and from that beg a safe still burning just as bring was removed and with some very strange unnatural hand gestures opened and in side was a very poisonous substance that was chalky white... or it would be if it wasn’t in the presence of a god. With the wind kain threw that in the volcano as well and began chanting  

Well chanting a seagull over the volcano dropped a jellyfish 

When kain finished chanting the volcano released a blast of divine light and there on the rim of the volcano was a little metal slime with prismatic eyes and little nubby horns it seemed to also be wearing  a Man’O war jellyfish on its head as a hat much to kain confusion 

[-8 for the as of now unnamed demigoddess of explosions ... she will get a real form and by extension name next turn -8 for explosion contorl and creation. If the blessing is wrong please let me know jorn ] 

Soon enough at lyva door of the tower she would hear a knock and when she would open the door she would find said metal slime at her door static electricity trialling to the exist of the divine tower. Attached was a note saying “ please take good care of this demigod ! I’m sure you and prismari will be great parents” the note was signed anonymous
