# The Overflow of Life [None]

It became clear to the Priests of the Order of Life that The Well of Life was growing stronger. The Vortex had been steadily growing quicker, and as such they had been able to harvest the Life Essence far more quickly than usual. The Priests largely saw this as a good thing... but they all feared that it was a herald of something worse yet to come. 

After all, Mair gave men the strength to fight their own battles... and Mair was sending them *a lot* of Life Essence. Thus, the Order of Life began to prepare for some unexpected disaster... never suspecting that it would come from the Well itself.

The Well Erupted for the first time in Mortal Memory, sending up a Miles-High Geyser of Life Essence. The Essence began to rain down upon the World in its liquid form... and in its far more concentrated Crystalline Form. The Geyser's bounty fell upon Amlah, The Goblin Lands, and the edges of the Prismatic Plains and adjacent Jungle on the distant continent. Its effects on the Ocean in the middle were difficult to measure.

The Liquid Life Essence had its usual effects upon the Soil... acting as a powerful fertilizing agent. Farmers and Gatherers would record unprecedented yields within the first year after the Geyser's Eruption. Those who were rained upon by the Essence would enjoy its healing effects. Those who had Rain-Buckets or Bird Baths made of stone would find an amazing discovery... Life Essence floating atop them. Nobody got much... but a few mouthfuls of the Essence were incredibly valuable.

The Crystalline Life Essence had an effect familiar to the residents of the Great Forest. It had fallen to their lands before, when the Comet Shard had finally fallen to the surface. Animals were drawn to the Crystals, and mutated into Dire Creatures when they consumed it.

The world was a bit more dangerous now.

[-13 Acts for the Life-Geyser Cycle Continental Metaphysics.]

> The Geyser erupts once a turn. Some Turns will have mild eruptions, and some turns will have major eruptions. The larger the Eruption, the more Essence will fall upon the world and the larger the Crystals will be.

> The Geysers scatter Life Essence in its Liquid Form across the entire effected area.

> The Geysers scatter Life Essence Crystals across the entire effected area, but the Crystals grow smaller as you get further from the Well of Life. Thus, the largest and nastiest Dire Animals spawn in Amlah.

> The Geysers scatter Liquid Life Essence, which will increase Crop Growth within the affected area.

[-3 Acts for Crystaline Life Essence.]

> Consuming Crystaline Life Essence results in a creature mutating into a "Dire" version of itself. These creatures are larger, more aggressive, and their natural weapons/defenses grow more potent.

> Mortals that consume Crystaline Life Essence experience rapid muscle and bone growth, enlarging them. They may also develop claws, talons, shark-like jaws, or other natural weapons. 

> Consuming too much Crystaline Life Essence will result in a creature growing too large to survive. They will die by one of three causes: Their Heart becoming unable to pump blood through their entire body, their skin splitting open and infection setting in, or their bones crumbling beneath their own weight.
