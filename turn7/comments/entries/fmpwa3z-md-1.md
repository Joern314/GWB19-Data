"Not much luck... hrrm... is there a method... or maybe a feeling to it? Is it supposed to be an instinct of the divine? How did Lyva learn it? You're right they should have told me, but we aren't family. Still, why didn't they...?" Gon babbled briefly before shifting back to the subject of the blade.

"It belonged to some-" Gon started, but stopped abruptly and furrowed his brow. "Wait... I remember... it... *that one..."*

Gon covered the left side of his face with one hand and gritted his teeth as a headache suddenly came on. After closing his eyes for a minute he felt better and exhaled heavily before he continued.

"There was one that had it before me, I think... I remember... I saw in my dreams another gryn... A pompous one with golden feathers who had a glittering sword at his side.  *That blade...* It was this one... I think... but why do I have it? Kain... if we were able to view it in an older form, before it had come so far, do you think the heroes sphere would work better? I understand their is a time god in this world..." Gon wondered then shivered oddly.
