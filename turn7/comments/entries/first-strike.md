# First Strike [None]
(Attackers: 6 - Defenders: 10)

Derak orders his forces to charge the wall, to get over it at any cost. The Dinosaur beasts are being held back, empowered by runes they might be but they are far to large to climb a wall.  
The Defenses of Amalah was however true to it's words, despite suffering a surprise attack, the defenders remained calm and quickly sounded alarms.  
Ladders were put up almost as soon as they were pushed down, a ram was slammed on to it's gates but they were constantly pelted with arrows.  

Soon, all the walls were covered in archers, defenders armed with sword and shields standing to push down assaults on the walls.

No mater how many times they attempted to take the walls or the gate, they were stopped. The Defenders manage to secure many of their injured back to be healed, suffering minor losses only.  
Soon, the attackers called off the assault for the day, this would take time.
