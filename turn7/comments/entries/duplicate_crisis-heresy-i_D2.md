# Crisis: Heresy I [None]

Thyval had a crisis of faith. There were disputes among the city about the Beloved Angel, and who she was in relation to the Witch. Some had claimed that they were once sisters, and they fell out after one chose the profane over sanctity. Some claimed that the Angel and the Witch were cosmic enemies, found at the beginning of time, always warring against one another. And, to Oryllia's dismay, some had said that they were one in the same, playing a charade to sap up faith.

Oryllia had a plan.

The High Exalter, the Seers of Sanctity, and many attendees had all witnessed a glorious display within the Pearl Temple. The altar was covered in holy fire, and their incense was lapped up by the very flames of the Angel.

Her ethereally beautiful form caused all to bow before her. Nothing like this ever happened in the many generations of the city's existence.

"My children, you quarrel over foolish things. Turn thine eyes back to me, and your purity shall be restored."
