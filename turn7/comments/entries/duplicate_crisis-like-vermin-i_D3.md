# Crisis: Like Vermin I [None]

The tribes of the Hunting Grounds know only to hunt what they need. And since all the magic they know is either not useful to the public, aside from hunting, there is not that much sacrifice for magic going on.

In fact most of the supernatural powers of the humans are based on the miracles of the Iron Law and the Waidm√§nner, which do not need any magical energies to sustain themselves. So the problems of the rest of the world, were not the problems of humanity.
