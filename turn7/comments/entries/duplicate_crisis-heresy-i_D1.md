# Crisis: Heresy I [None]

The Vengeful was getting uneasy. Some were talking if they should try to return to Amalah, or take up new ways again.

Derak, the Vampire Lord of Redgash knew something would be needed. Having his new army tear itself apart would hardly make a good army, they need to survive until they reach Amalah so they can take it after all.

Derak was unease about the Red God, for he had pointed him in the right direction and obviously would not be fond if he failed, he was almost afraid of the Red God.  
Then, one day, he found a blade. The blade was of exeptional quality, with the name *Ras* engraved on it.  

Derak had a smith look over the blade but the smith could not lift the blade. Only Derak could.

Derak did what he does best and loudly declared the time had come for the sword. He had been given a holy blade, one only he could wield.  
They would gather arms and take the fight back to Amalah in a Righteous Crusade.

The army gathered, weapons enchanted by followers of the Sorcerers, trained Dinosaurs, some even enchanted as well. Vampires Derak himself had sired to act as his generals, lieutenants and champions.

They set out toward Amalah once more...

[GM: I well the Heresy by focusing them all on a single task, by giving the leader that artifact weapon from the First King

/u/gwydion-drys, battle about to begin.

How you want this to be done?  
rolling to see how far the Bloody Crusade gets? Determine something on discord?

My suggestion:  
I give a rough number of strength I think the Vengeful have.  
You give a rough number you think the defenders have.  
We roll a dice and measure up the result

The Vengeful got...
Vampires +1  
Blood Enhancement (used by many, not just a small group) +1  
Dinosaurs +1  
Surprise attack (+1 for first round only, this is after all, the first major attack on Amalah in any living memory)  
so +3 (+4 on first roll).

Let's roll d6 3 times.  
if I win 1 roll, the Crusade gets over the first defensive wall (so first fail, second succeed, means the crusade gets over the wall by the second attempt).  
More rolls is just how much damage to deals before being driven off.

If we do this, here are my rolls just to speed it along. [I use this dice roller, allows you to tag on modifiers right away](https://www.wizards.com/dnd/dice/dice.htm)

Roll 1: **6** (2+4)  
Roll 2: **9** (6+3)  
Roll 3: **8** (5+3)  
Yes, I rolled really nicely the 2 last rolls :D ]
