Halmeus traveled the seas with his crew far and wide, eventually winding up near a vast city whose inhabitants had named Thyval situated on a vast red plains near a horrible waste-like place after having been blown off course significantly by a fierce storm. He traded some of their goods for this interesting material that seemed to shine with the eyes of their divine patron, and even it's name sounded similar to that of their god also he bartered for the bodies for some of the Unliving of these cities, of people that would shortly die or had already experienced the First Death as Halmeus and his people called it, claiming his people had a use for them paying the bereaved's family a comparatively handsome sum. Halmeus ventured far and wide in search of trade routes and interesting sights to see though he frequented this great city for trade, using the Cantrip that allowed for the use of the stars to guide oneself accurately to traverse the great distances.

Eventually he would take his time and carve a small settlement at the base of the sea spire, where he and his crew would base themselves with their families, surviving off the fish of the ocean and imported goods from Halmeus' lucrative trading operations. The people of this settlement began to worship the Thyvalian interpretation of Malaphet, with some strange mixing of the two as they cast Malaphet as the equal of the Angel worshipped by the people of Thyval

\[ /u/DragoneyeCreations I have people coming around Thyval trying to by Malaphite and Unliving in exchange for various services and other trade goods, I imagine Malaphite isn't something your people would have an issue with selling as it's a trade good, but maybe they'd be more hesitant to sell them their Unliving, but thats up to you.\]
