# None [None]
Gon, having been on top of Lyva, was not only caught up in as much of the explosion as she was, but what remained of him was blown way off of the sun since the force came from underneath him.

When he came to, he found himself facing the sun on the surface of a moon made completely out of nephrite between himself and the planet he called Ranosken below. The sudden appearance of this moon causing an eclipse. Though he didn't realize immediately that he had made it to catch himself from the explosion, Gon appreciated having a place to lay down for a moment. He was dead tired for some reason. Slowly his mind cleared up and he vaguely remembered fighting with... a dragon?

"Lyva..." He groaned as he remembered and craned his neck to look around and his tail thumped against the surface of the moon unbidden.

"Tail?" He muttered out loud in surprise as he looked down at himself. He was covered in black scales that had closed up older wounds and green scales made apparently out of the same material as the surrounding moon, while   
white veins of quartz marked all of his previous scars. How long had he been out? As best he could figure, he must have used the moon to piece himself back together. After...

"LYVA!!!"

"Kzzzizzzaal nkeliil... Gotta get... UP! Kzzz'man, Nkan." He growled as he scrambled and scraped at the ground with the claws and hands on both feet, trying to get up and balance himself in this strange new form. After a moment of unsteadiness he managed to get up and craned his neck around as the stone feathers that accented his head, arms, spine, and tail stood on end. With great trouble he expanded his his senses... she wasn't on any stone... where...

Coughing up a little molten blood between his sharp teeth, he wiped the side of his muzzle with a clawed hand. *Muzzle?* This was not the time for such questions he convinced himself, and adjusted to reach out again. It was faint, but he could make it out. He took a few clumsy steps to the left, then right, looking to get the trajectory right, before crouching low with a severe growl of pain. He wasn't sure he could use the lava blades to propel himself again, and teleporting... hell, he was just having trouble standing.

"Keep it togetherrr, body... jussst forrr a bit." He breathed as he summoned up the strength of the moon beneath him for a mighty leap towards where he sensed Lyva.

Having located her, he attempted to collect as much of her up as he could and using all most all of what energy he had left teleported the two of them to her room in the tower on the moon, expecting, but not knowing for certain, that she would have stuff stashed their to eat and recover from her damage.

As tired as he was, his teleport was not the best and he basically appeared in mid air and crash landed on his back, coughing up some more lava-blood, before managing to put her on a bed. With a small laugh, he turned to leave.

"We can sssorrrt out who won laterrr." Gon muttered, but then as he tried to take another step it all caught back up with him; the teleport had been too much too soon, and he wavered, stumbled forward, laughed, coughed up some more blood, and collapsed into unconsciousness once more.

\[-5 for the Nephite Moon (Gloon'srikzo). Nephite is a form of jade, so this moon is  a bright green. It is in a different orbit than the other moon and passes in front of the sun to create eclipses occasionally.\]
