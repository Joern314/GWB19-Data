# Prompt: The Invisible Silk Roads [None]

The jumbled primarily imported bodies or parts thereof from the surrounding areas. To that purpose they had created little villages towns of jumbled in the surrounding regions. The jumbled offered to take care of the unliving and often helped the injured and maimed regaining the body parts they had lost in accidents or wars so prevalent to the second continent.

The one thing besides bodies they imported were gems. The jumbled on their mountains lived in the natural caves of the mountain. And they tried to improve the caves with their natural skill at crafts Glypha had taught them. And the gems were a decoration the jumbled normally lacked on their mountains.

So in the little village of jumbled near the goblin territories, jumbled mostly made from goblin parts could be found, giving thanks to Gon Gryn for the gifts of the earth. While still sticking to a simple life routine as herders and flesh knitters if the need arose.
