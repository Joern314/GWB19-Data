# None [None]
Lyva was away examining an undersea volcano, but felt the knock on the door and curiously manifested there, only to feel a stinging shock in her toes. Then she noticed the blob and found herself staring at it and the note.    

"No."     

Lyva stamped inside her floor and slammed the door shut behind her.    

"NO!"      

Lyva burnt the note and stamped back outside, picking the metal blob up. Could she unmake it? Probably, but that was a waste of energy for this.

"No," She said softly, then marched down the stairs with the blob to knock on Oryllia's door, drop the blob, and teleport away.
