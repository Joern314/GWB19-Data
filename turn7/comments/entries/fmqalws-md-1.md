**Dreams of Divinity: The Fated End**

*"It is done, Sraalr. The spell cannot be broken now." Gon announced into the darkness of the divine prison cell. The creature inside rumbled in what could have been laughter.*

*"Nkan, nkan... sssrrrenillaal? Well done, brrrotherrr. You have finally come back-k-k arrround. Irrraug gemo. Gelod asrrr rrroenenk-k-k gbol bimsen?" Gon's brother rumbled from the darkness.*

*"Can you really blame me brother? ...she was so kind to me." Gon replied in an empty tone and folded his arms to lean against the black walls of the musty prison, opposite his brother's cell.*

*"Liesss. Ill leossss, Nkan. Sssee how fassst they dissscarrrded me when I dissspleasssed them?" The voice replied as two golden reptilian eyes turned to look at them from the bed in the cell. Their luminous appearance seemed very familiar. "Gegboaal anlaal msssingod ga uso aalau."*

*"Now they will pay. All of them, yes... the worldfire... They will never escape it now. They will all burn." Gon replied with a mad grin. The creature shuffled and stood in the cell and with heavy footsteps stepped close to the divinely reinforced bars. The lizard creature gripped the bars tightly with clawed hands its mouth full of thick fangs meant for crushing bones. Rough purple feathers accented the back of its head and arms's otherwise shiny black scales in the gloom as it turned its head to one side to look at Gon more clearly with one eye.*

*The dream warped oddly again and once more a little voice broke in as a golden gryn slipped its hand into Gon's left hand.*

*"Awake, brother! This is no-"*

*Gon reacted by shoving the little gryn off, before rushing to the now empty cell.*

"Brother, tell me mo-" Gon yelled as awoke once more.

"Father Gon? Why didn't you tell me you had a brother? You should have introduced me." Livi pouted as she shoveled lava out of an erupting volcano that Gon had apparently decided to take a nap by. Gon ignored her and looked at his left hand, which now more closely resembled his brothers, claws and all. Three fresh runes had appeared above the bandage on his arm. He suspected that there was no likely only scales underneath the bandage now. At least this dream gave him some answers.

"The worldfire... I had something to do with that?" Gon laughed madly before calming down again as he flexed his clawed hand curiously. It felt a little stiff, but maybe these runes were a good thing. Lyva could alter her shape; maybe he just needed to figure out how to do it like godsight.

"Maybe... I... I wonder what that little one had to say." He double guessed his actions in the dream.

"Father Gon, They say talking to yourself is the first step to madness... did you get hit in the head to many times like me? Wait, oooh are you talking to your brother? Is he really tiny?"

"N-no! Just... keep up the good work, Livi." Gon replied as he jumped up and brushed himself off, accidentally tearing the white robes with his clawed hand. Before Livi could make some comment on that he quickly vanished, returning to his temple caves and swearing up an earthquake. Thankfully, these were just words and he didn't actually put any divine power into it or else there might have been a lot of dead Nkarlen.
