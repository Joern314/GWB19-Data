# Prompt: A Purely Mortal Struggle II [None]

Yrdin the hunter in his “exile” in the hunting grounds learned about the mistreatment of the “heretics” and the atrocities the Inner Council was comiting. Yrdin's goal had been to join the caste of Guardians and prove that he was a warrior. 

But thinking about his family and their safety he realized. It was not more warriors the city of Epoidos needed. And so he had changed his goal from becoming a warrior to becoming an Iron Judge. And he succeded by showing and proving devotion to the Iron Law.

He returned to Epoidos and found those given the powers of Iron Judges and demonstrating their mandate given by the god of law. The Inner Council appointed him to the caste of Philosophers to serve as a moral backbone to the ruling class.
