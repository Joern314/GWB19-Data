Trade was not dead to the Vengeful, sometimes, trade flowed back up toward the village from the jungle.

Mostly, it was small things such as dyes made from Jungle flowers, scales and leather to use in armor and tool making.  
very rarely however, one could come across a cage with a captured dinosaur in it. These large lizard creatures could be a valued price for any person of great wealth.  
A mighty beast of burden, or a devastating mount, or just prestige of owning such a exotic creature.
