# Katabasis [Necromancy]

The act of traveling the Rift and seeking out the dead is fraught with peril, however necromancers undertaking this risk will find the dead much more willing to deal with them and following their commands. The spirits of the dead the necromancer wishes to employ then accompany the necromancer to the prime material plane. To allow them to do such their way needs to be paid by magical energies. In essence the mage visits the ghost and accompanies him to do his magical task.
