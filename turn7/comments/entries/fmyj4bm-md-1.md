**A Purely Mortal Struggle: Dealego the Bloody**

Part 2: Blood on the Stones

Dealego's vengeance was swift. Nkarlen had little time in their lives for hesitation. Using his knowledge of the major players in the Milerlo Misrei and those close to them, he sought out the less connected members and killed the or tortured them in the twisting side caves of Kzivo'gbamo. As the murders continued, Dealego started to enjoy the process of killing them, of watching their blood drain from their throats after he slit them.

With the rumours circulating of blood drinking coming from the south, it was perhaps only a matter of time until he started trying to become stronger by drinking blood from his victims; he wanted the power, no, he *needed* the power to destroy the Misrei in the open. Killing them one by one was far to slow.

His caves slowly became a bloody mess as Dealego started worshiping the flayed god and sacrificed more and more goblins to him, as he switched to knocking them out and dragging them back to his caves. He even started making clothing and hats from their skins.

He escaped the wrath of the inhabitants only because of the ongoing inquistion and the infighting among the Misrei, as they were happy to make use of the trouble facing the Milerlo Misrei to expand their influence.

It was all a bit short sighted when Dealego managed to gather a whole fanatic group to his cause, rounded up the main family in charge of the Milerlo, and sacrificed them in a ritual in his secret hideout, becoming the first goblin vampire with a mouth viscous flesh ripping teeth.

\[-6 for Dealego bloodline: -3 for blood bond - others that are in contact with blood from this bloodline suffer wounds equivalent to the ones inflicted on the vampire from who the blood originates. -3 for feral blood - the scent of blood from these vampires' blood slowly drives others not of this bloodline into a feral state of pure aggression without reason.\]
