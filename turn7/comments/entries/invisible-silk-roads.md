# The Invisible Silk Roads [None]

One of the blood riders tribes, half way to the forest where the rangers live.  
They were one of the few tribes that were somewhat half-friendly with the forest men.

Sometimes, they even traded with them. Sometimes, a trader comes from them, maybe from land far away to buy their horses.

The tribe had developed a habit of fighting other tribes for their horses to trade them.

They had heard ideas coming from the forest people, the idea of 'law'.  
Most of it was rubbish of course.

But some of them started to adopt a code of honor, the idea of procedure for things.  
Of course, that was only for them, outsiders had no such protection.
