# Heresy [None]

Mair was **normally** the type of Divinity that liked to let their followers deal with their problems on their own. The God of War was happy to give them the strength they needed and show them what direction to travel along, but Mair wouldn't fight their battles for them. Truth would be found through debate or through battle, as viewpoints clashed with one-another (metaphorically or not) as was proper.

*Then* Mair's Worshipers started treating the God of War and Life as a Divine Authority, and began to threaten Mair's displeasure upon those who would not follow their way. It became clear to Mair that some ground rules needed to be set... and that they needed to be set on a large scale.

Thus, Mair reached out to the Faithful and sent a strongly worded dream to her Clergy. The dream clarified Mair's position on contentious issues, laid down Mair's actual philosophy, and gave a vivid description of what The God of Life could *and would* do to the genitals of anyone who continued to put words in its mouth.

For some reason, people responded more strongly to threats of genital mutilation than they did to death threats. That threat would persist among Mair's Clergy for generations, and be immortalized in written scriptures.

[-1 Act to Contact my Clergy, and explain that they're worshiping a War God that doesn't really care about their petty issues.]

[Also, I pulled a Dionysis and threatened to do horrific things to everyone's junk if they kept dragging my name into their arguments. This should restore orthodoxy for awhile.]

> *Basic Overview of Mair's Tenets:*

> Be Prepared for the Struggle for Survival. Danger will come to you in time.

> Resolve your Differences through Conflict. Face each-other in the open, and do not let spite and grudges fester.

> Debate is an Honorable Battlefield. Respect the Consensus that forms, but do not be afraid to revisit an issue.

> Cry out to the Gods for Strength, not for Salvation. We are but Guides. We cannot walk your Path or fight your Battles for you.

> Seek Challenges and grow your Strength, but do not waste your life. A Dead Warrior is of no good to anyone.

> Choose your Battlefields well, and choose your Moment *better*. Strength and Training win fights, but Discretion and Foresight win Battles.
