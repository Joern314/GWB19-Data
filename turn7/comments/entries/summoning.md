# Summoning [Necromancy]

Under the use of runes taught by the Sorcerer and consumption of magical energies a ghost can be raised straight from the Rift. However planar travel tends to muddle the mind, even of the dead, so any answers ghosts summoned this way are to be taken with a grain of salt and they may object to be torn out of the afterlife and spells they are employed for may be less potent.
