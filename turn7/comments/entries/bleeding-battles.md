# Bleeding Battles [None]
(Attackers: 8 - Defenders: 8)

The city defenses were of course, a masterful art by the defenders.  
While the Vengeful owned the streets with their powerful champions, the vampires and mighty war beasts, the inside of buildings and alleyways were a different mater.

Whenever the Vengeful believed to have secured a street or district, new defenders would emerge to attack them.

The Order of war also shined during this time, now concentrated instead of spread out, they took the fight to the vampires.  
Even if a single vampire was far stronger than anyone of them could ever hope, for every vampire, there must have been at least 3 soldiers of the order. By coordinating their strikes on them, they could injure them enough to bring them down on the ground, or force their retreat.

The battle of the districts was a long and painful process, both attackers and defenders bleeding dry.

Eventually, Derak was forced to sound the horn of retreat, falling back outside the walls after setting fire to many buildings to prevent pursuit.
