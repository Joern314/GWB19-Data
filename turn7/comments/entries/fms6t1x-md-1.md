"The Rift itself is a place between realities. Even now it is mostly in the void only anchored to this reality by the Rift Woods, that serve as it entrances. The Rift itself has passageways to many other worlds, which however are sealed as long as the Rift is tethered to this world having to do with divine power and mortal worship. It is nearly impossible to be in two realities at once. But my mentor's library contains many ways to find new and empty realities or describes numerous ways to return to previously visited ones. It is harder to find realities who other gods already inhabited and built up and go there in my experience." The Sorcerer elaborated. "If the one calling you uses magic or technology the signal should be easily to counteract with anti-magic or something interfering with technology. Divine power is trickier. The most reliable way there would be to unmake what is contacting you. But nothing would hinder its architect to just employ another method of contact or the same one anew. The most reliable way to rid yourself, at least for a while, of the signal would be incarnation or inhabiting your own plane, whose metaphysics you would be the master of."
