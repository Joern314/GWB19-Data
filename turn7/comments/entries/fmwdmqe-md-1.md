Contact with the sun started to melt Gon almost immediately, who flailed as his already damaged leg melted first, causing him to collapse into the the surface of the sun, growling wildy at her.

Slowly something different started to happen as the molten parts seemed to ebb and flow and his left arm started to give off a green color as the scales instantly ignited and started to burn away sacrificially to provide protection to him like ceramic tiles. 

The scales seemed to spread and his legs reformed to something closer to that of the dinosaur like predators that stalked the savage jungles on the planet below. The lava blades themselves were pulled into half molten Gon and formed into a tail that lashed as the half reptilian Gon wrapped in green flames staggered up onto his new feet with a mad grin and golden eyes fixed on Lyva.

There was also a small shift in the sensation of being in Gon's presence as the vengeance aura seemed to disappear.

"Kzzzamo an, rrrenk ano!!!" Her roared up at her with his hands spread wide in a half crouched stance looking like he was going to try to leap up at her. "I won't sssurrrenderrr thisss time! You have to win fairrr and sssquarrre!"

Despite this bluster, Gon had suffered quite a bit of damage, though he seemed to be ignoring it somehow.
