Metals were the clear candidate for a currency. However, there were serious problems with this approach. It was difficult to establish relative value between the metals, it was even harder to ensure that a lump of metal was pure, and it was relatively common for a merchant to refuse payment in one metal or another.

This problem was resolved by the Guild of Silversmiths. They produced a series of Coins of uniform weight and design, and guaranteed purity. They also setup an exchange rate internally between the metal coins, which they adjusted periodically at regular intervals. This allowed them to implement a functional currency for Gwanyin.
