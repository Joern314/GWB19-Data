# Crisis: Heresy I [None]

The people of the Hunting Grounds and Sanctuary knew that indeed Rictus only considered one thing real heresy â€“ subversion and perversion of the Iron Law. And to resolve these issues the Iron Inquisition and the Lawbringers existed. 

Religion was not bound to the Iron Law. People were free to believe in what they wanted, as long as they adhered to the tenants and rules of the Iron Law.
