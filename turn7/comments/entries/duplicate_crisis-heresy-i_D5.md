# Crisis: Heresy I [None]

The people of the jumbled mountains had started debating cities, magic and a whole host of other things that made life easier and led to mortals not cherishing life like they should. So in her will to keep them on the right track she made the jumbled Lyva and Glypha had made into her prophet.

The woman with a prehinsile tail made of arms and hands for feet was called Flika. Flika was Glypha's newest prophet. She sent Flika to the people of the jumbled mountains to remind them of the teachings of Glypha.
