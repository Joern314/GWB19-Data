"Oh, yes, I am Gon." Gon laughed, realizing he had not introduced himself because he had been too interested in the magic.

"So when combined with that mind burn spell...

You could merely transfer all their memories and skills onto a blank slate... though perhaps the body differences... Hrrm..." Gon mumbled before shaking his head once more. 

"Ah, getting distracted again, excuse me. What I wanted to ask was: are you aware of any spells that can bridge the void between two separate worlds? I suspect someone... or *something* is trying to either draw me away or affect who I am. The true purpose escapes me."
