# A Purely Mortal Struggle II [None]

Raldric had been training.  
He was using Blood empowerment more and more than ever, he was a champion of Redgash.  
He, however, unlike all the other champions, refused the gift of the Red God, vampirism.

He felt he could only be worthy if the Red God spoke to him, or if he performed a mighty deed. a Deed that no one could ever foresee.

The blood empowerment had made him mighty strong.  
He could punch the mighty beasts of the jungle, killing them in a single blow.

But he felt he needed more. And the call of war had come.

[/u/andrewjamesdrake, Raldric might show up in the war and be a full on badass]
