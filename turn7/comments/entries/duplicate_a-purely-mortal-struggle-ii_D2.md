# A Purely Mortal Struggle II [None]

Laeghaill returned to the Order's headquarters, retrieving his arms and armaments. Blood was to be spilled, and the Angel damn him to the Wastes if there was no forgiveness.

He entered into the streets of Thyval, covering himself in rags and hiding among the lower populous. He communed with those desperate of spiritual guidance, helping them and restoring their hope in the Angel, but also used them as means to find those who took his love's life.

When he found them, his sword was thrumming with fury, same as his pendant. Under the cover of night, Laeghaill rode to the edge of the Wastes, with his offenders dragged behind his horse by ropes around their ankles.

Bound by rope and fear, the lowlifes, those cruel traitors, were kicked into a poisonous pool, and Laighaill, with the Angel's assurance of their curses on their souls, still feared over his own. But the Angel's voice, for the first time, rang in his soul.

"Vengeance no more. Pain leave you, Laeghaill. Though accursed, the scales have been tipped. And now, all is right."
