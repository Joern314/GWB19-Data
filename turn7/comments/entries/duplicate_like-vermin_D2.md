The Priests of the Order of Life were the first to *realize* the danger that Magic posed to their food supply. They also knew that they couldn't lose the advantage that came from the Rune-Enchantments upon their Defenders' Armor and Weapons. Thus... the Order of Life was presented with a Battlefield suited for their particular talents and tools. It was a Logistical Battle, and the Priest-Bureaucrats of the Order of Life spent their lives fighting such battles.

The initial fix was a simple one, a patch-job meant to minimize damage until a more permanent solution could be conceived of and implemented. The Slaughter of Animals for food within the walls of Gwanyin was the sole province of the City's Butchers. It was relatively easy for the Priests to arrange cooperation between the Butchers and the Mages, allowing the Mages to charge the Runic Enchantments upon the City's Weapons more freely. As this was the primary use of Magic in Gwanyin, this worked as a stopgap solution.

A Detachment of Priest-Bureaucrats were dispatched to Audit the City's Magic-Users. They were to assess the number of Animals that needed to be killed to fuel the City's Magical Economy, and devise a method to estimate the annual growth rate. This was relatively simple in the case of Magic Items, but a bit of a challenge regarding other forms of magic. Still, it took them only a few years to gather enough information to build a solid calculation upon.

The Temple Bureaucracy then set about the business of building a Supply Chain for Dernas's Magic Users. They arranged for Food to be grown, Livestock to be raised, and special Markets to be setup for the sale of Sacrificial Animals. The Purchase of Sacrificial Animals was a privilege reserved to the City's Mages, who had to acquire a License from the Temple of Life to purchase their Sacrificial Animals.

The Temple then placed modest fines upon Magic Users that used Non-Sacrificial Animals outside of an emergency. This ordinance was difficult to enforce. However, it had just enough teeth to produce an artificial division between the Sacrificial Animal Market and the Food Animal Market. This insulated the Food Supply from being unduly influenced by the Mages' practice.

[We've resolved the crisis through bureaucracy.]

[There's now a complex economic construct dedicated to mass-producing chickens, goats, and other sacrificial animals for use by Mages. Since most of those Animals can still be used for food *after* the Mage is done with them, this shouldn't have too many unfortunate side effects.]
