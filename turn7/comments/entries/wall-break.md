# Wall Break [None]
(Attackers : 9 - Defenders: 7)

A new strategy would be demanded, Derak summoned his vampire champions and gave them their new tasks.  

As morning dawned, a new assault began. The Defenders believed this would just be a repeat of the the day before but that is when they were struck from behind.  
Vampires, flying vampires, they flew high and then descended on the walls, being far more powerful than any mortal, they killed, almost flew around the walls, killing but a few to allow the unliving to strike back at their ones allies in life.  
The walls were in chaos. Aerial assaults were unheard of, only birds flew as far as most men knew.  
A few tried to fight these vampires, but even if they got in a deadly wound on them by shear luck, the vampires simply laughed and cut them down instead.

Using this chaos, the rams struck back at it's gates, even using a trained giant lizard creature to pound the gates down.

And when the gates fell, the Vengeful army poured though it.  
Powered by blood, and might giant beasts charging at the defenders, it was clear this breach could not be retaken.  
Now, a urban fight had begun.
