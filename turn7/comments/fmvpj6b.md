The art of communing with the spirits of the dead and employ them for the mages ends and means, either by traveling to the Rift and dealing with them directly, or by summoning them into the prime material plane by use of magical runes and rituals. There are two ways to cast any spell of necromancy.

####Katabasis

The act of traveling the Rift and seeking out the dead is fraught with peril, however necromancers undertaking this risk will find the dead much more willing to deal with them and following their commands. The spirits of the dead the necromancer wishes to employ then accompany the necromancer to the prime material plane. To allow them to do such their way needs to be paid by magical energies. In essence the mage visits the ghost and accompanies him to do his magical task.

####Summoning

Under the use of runes taught by the Sorcerer and consumption of magical energies a ghost can be raised straight from the Rift. However planar travel tends to muddle the mind, even of the dead, so any answers ghosts summoned this way are to be taken with a grain of salt and they may object to be torn out of the afterlife and spells they are employed for may be less potent.

####Purposes

The use of necromancy serves three primary purposes: the acquisition of knowledge, the conjuration of illusions and the manipulation of the will of the living.

- Knowledge: The dead can trade knowledge after death or share knowledge they possessed in life. However after a year and a day in the Rift their minds start to forget and the knowledge they can provide dwindles. (3 acts for spells + 2 for secret)

- Illusion:   Depending on if the necromancer wants to show people good or bad events in an illusion, a soul is summoned either from the Sleeping City or the Endless Woods. The blessed souls from Oneiros, the Sleeping City can show others the dreams dreamt by the dead, resulting in an enjoyable illusion. Damned souls from the Endless Woods share their nightmares and horrors with people. (3 acts for spells + 2 for secret)

- Manipulation of Will: A necromancer can not outright mind control a person. However by summoning the ghosts of the Rift a sort of post-hypnotic suggestion can be laid on people, by ghosts whispering into people's ears and minds ideas, feelings or courses of action of the necromancer's will.
