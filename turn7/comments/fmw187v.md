# Like Vermin

"FOOLS!" Sunda was *not impressed* with the mortals that claimed to follow him. He was the Wild Lord, his very name was synonymous with nature, and yet these mortals dared defile his lands.

"How dare you take without returning. How dare you plunder the wilds so." He growled, stepping towards the crowd that had gathered in the burgeoning city. It wasn't far from Sunda-Tor, north-east a short ways to be precise. He had watched them, and he was not impressed by what he saw.

"Here my words now, and listen: You must give back to the lands, you must not simply take. Give more than is given to you. These are my words to you now, follow them."

And so he left, vanishing in a crash of thunder.
