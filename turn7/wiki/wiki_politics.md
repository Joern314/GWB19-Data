In mainstream Apokryph-society people are born into one of three castes. The castes are determined by the runic markings on their bodies they are born with. These marks are interpreted by the Sorcerer's priests or other representatives how to at birth.

The three castes and their societal roles are as follows:

**Philosophers** are the administrative caste. Their caste provide civic leaders, priests and scholars. They are born with magically enhanced intellect.

**Guardians** are the martial caste of the Apokryph-society. They serve as warriors, police as well as intelligence gatherers and in times of need assassins. They are born with magically enhanced speed, strength, dexterity and agility.

**Citizens** are the working caste of the Apokryph. Artists, artisans, farmers, hunters and every other profession requiring workers is part of this caste. They are born with magically enhanced endurance, patience and health.

**Mages** are born with an intuitive grasp of magic and extreme magical talent. They play a separated role in society. They are not bound by the restrictions of the castes. Their role is to teach the different castes how to harness their innate magical powers and to use their magic effectively and to keep the magical knowledge of the Apokryphs. They also are tasked with guarding Apokryph-society against magical and supernatural threats.
Innate magical are awakened in a religious ceremony wherein a small animal is sacrificed by the child to awaken their power to the Sorcerer or whichever god the Apokryph follow.

#### The Rift Keepers

These are the old Apokryphes choosing to mostly stay in the Rift. They have seen other realities and are weary of the world. But they do run through reincarnation all the same, their souls just never leave the Rift anymore, unless they are sent to collect the souls of dead people from the prime material plane.

If they do this duty they are hooded and cloaked, faced hidden behind masks. They carry lanterns of Rift Tree fruit to guide along the dead. 

Rift Keeper society largely follows the conventions laid out by the Sorcerer for the future (See nations – Magocracy).

### Blood Riders Soceity

Description: A collection of many different tribes living in the blood plains. Nomadic, herding deer and riding horses.

**Values:** The Blood Riders value strength and action. A stronger leader is far more respected then a wise or intelligent leader.  
Practical skills are also valued highly, ridding skill, leather-working, and fighting skills.

**Structures:** The blood riders are separated in to many different tribes. While each one might have it's own custom and ways, they all value strength. As such, the chief tends to be the strongest warriors in the tribe, while the title often goes from father to son, it's not unusual for it to see the chief be challenged and defeated.  
Alliances and blood feuds are common and change often, being so focused on the now and living life fully, they often do not focus on generation old grudges, if the oldest member of a tribe that remembers the original grudge dies, it often vanish with him.

**Location:** Located all over the blood plains.

### Jumbled-Society

In accordance with the commands of their goddes the Jumbled try to live rather simple lives. They herd goats on their mountains, forage the woods below and with the improved technical skills in shaping stone and working with tools given to them by Glypha they make the caves of the Jumbled Mountains their home.

To outsiders they often trade their skills in knitting flesh to flesh and replacing limbs. With the outside world they primarily trade corpses and body parts needed for their own reproduction.

### Thyvian

Description: The Thyvians are the descendants of the Turmoiled tribe, down in the western reaches of the Blood Plains and right on the border of the Wastes of Pain.

**Culture** - Thyvians have a heavy cultural emphasis on piety, modesty, and respect towards one another. It is said that their ancestors' debaucherous behavior was the reason for the blight for their destined homeland. Common attire for men and women involve covering the entire body, with long sleeved tunics and robes that reach to their knees being a place holder outfit. Cleanliness is another focus of their culture, with one washing another as a sign of kindness.

**Religion** - The Thyvians worship a goddess called the Angel of Purity, a being said to be an exemplar of modesty and respect. Their culture practices a religious philosophy called the Rebuke. This involves a daily denial of the Witch's influence on the city, acknowledging the curses that she rains over them, and a personal declaration of respect and blessings towards others. The priests, called "the Witch's Rejecters", devote themselves to shouting among the streets, denying the Witch every morning and every night. Over their faces sit a clean slate mask with their light blue robes.

**Government** - Thyval is governed by a council called the "Fair Elders", who are voted upon by the residents of the city every 7 years. Within the central spire of the city sits the Erudite Vault, where the Elders meet to consult with each other on governing the city.

## Mortal Races

### The Apokryph

**Creator**: The Sorcerer, Lyva

**Amended**: -

**Description**: Apokryph look a lot like slightly taller than average humans. They have gray skin and night-blue eyes. Their hair colors range from white and gray over brown to black. The Apokryph are born with dark runic markings on their bodies. These markings change with the stories of their lives. 

The Sorcerer and his clergy can read these markings to determine the caste an Apokryph belongs to. As these markings change the stations and powers of an Apokryph, his or her station change in life and Apokryph-society. They also have horns to commemorate the hand of Lyva in their creation.

In their veins flows a great amount of magic extending their natural life spans up to 300 years. Additionally, they have innate magical powers making them more adept at the jobs their caste is tasked with, as Apokryph society is intended by their original creator to be a caste structure. Currently, the Apokryph can however not access their life spans and innate magic as they are not yet accustomed to life in this new world.

A race of mortals created by the goddess Glypha. They are produced when another jumbled cobbles together a roughly humanoid body from parts of corpses or lobbed of body parts.

### Nkarlen, the Cave Goblins

/u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW [Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flu8tjs/)

The Nkarlen are a race of four to five feet tall agile pointy-eared humanoids with crooked noses and angry looking eyes. They are extreme omnivores and will attempt to eat anything and everything. They have incredibly strong teeth and stomach acid and can therefore eat even small rocks. Created by a god of vengeance, they have a tendency to never forget even the smallest slight. When this is combined with their natural lack of sympathy, they can become hell-bent on payback. They are short-lived - their average max life span is only 40 years - but they breed like rabbits; it is common for one pair of goblins to have ten to twelve children.

They have a naturally agile and skinny physique allowing them to slip through their caves and holes quickly. Their skin is usually a mottled gray/brown, but extended exposure to light turns them green. Those goblins who never leave their caves often develop darker brown skin to the point where it is almost black. Their voices usually range from shrill to guttural with nothing in between. Goblins with normal voices are rare.

### Yashool

## Nations

### The city of Raha’stal

Over the years as the beast slayer Rahab strength and night grew so to did the village of the prismatic plains

Soon rahab had a grand ambitions. He envisioned at the base of the mountain path leading to the pilgrimage of heroes... a grand city that could one day house every hero in existence... and he would lay it’s foundation 

Using the bone of the fallen fallen dire beast he had slain he created the first of many building what would one day in the future be called the hall of heroes.... but for now it was just rahab house. His people fallowed his lead and created there own house each with unique  architecture... no two looking the same. 
It was easy to tell those who where heroes with in the city for there house almost always included the bone of dire beast in there construction and so the city of Raha’stal was born 

Over the years as Raha’stal grew other tribes of the prismatic plains cane to join the every growing city of heroes,  attracted by it tails of mighty mortals who could grab ahold of possible and protect the ones the love 

That wasn’t the only reason the population of Raha’stal boomed no one of its hero residents in the first half of its Existence named Umah the green handed discovered a great way to feed the nation with the technique of Moderate Farming(-4 for moderate farming ) with a little helping hand of Prismari even if she didn’t know and was accredited with the creation. 

Mortals also stayed for the general sense of community, lead by what where  once the zepho tribe, yet it had become the zepho guild of heroes , whom welcomed  any and all into its ranks. So long as they could uphold the ideas that all must who join must help the weaker members of the ever growing city
### The City on the Well

The Worshipers of Mair have built a pale reflection of the Temple of Life, and they have begun to build a city around it. This City's Name is Gwanyin. Immigrants were initially drawn to the City by the promise of Life Essence. They were made to stay within the city by the easy access to life-saving Essence, and the comforts born of the City's rapidly advancing technology.

#### Civil Defense
All men and women who live within the walls of Gwanyin are trained in the Basic Arts of War. 

The City supplies each person with a Spear, a Shield, a bow, and basic armor. Craftsmen and other wealthy individuals are expected to outfit themselves in more exceptional equipment. Professional Soldiers are selected from members of the Labor Class who show exceptional aptitude at War, and Officers are promoted form their ranks. Professional Soldiers are given equipment suited to their role, and spend their peace-time as a Guard-Force within the city.

Everyone old enough to train is expected, and scheduled, to report to one of the City's Mustering Grounds once a week. These Courtyards are located next to the Temple of Life, and they are large enough for a force of men to practice moving in formation, combat in formation, and then split off for one-on-one sparring. The practice is overseen by a member of the Order of War, who is enjoying a day off from *their* training to spread their wisdom to lesser warriors.

In the event of the City coming under attack, every man and woman within its walls is capable of joining the defense. Only Artisans, such as Blacksmiths and Architects, are expected to remain off the walls in such an event. Their *knowledge* and skill is seen as too valuable to risk in battle.

#### The Essence Economy
Just as the City is physically centered on the Well of Life, its Economy is similarly centered upon the Life Essence drawn from the Well.

The Well is sheltered in the Temple of Life, a Fortress-Temple dedicated to Mair. It is a Sacred Place to the Men of Dernas, and the center of their City-State's Governance. It is a place of Healing, of Stockpiling Food against famine, and the last line of defense against those who seek to conquer The Well of Life. The Temple of Life is home to *two* Holy Orders. 

> **The Orders of the Temple**
>
> The Order of Life is the Peaceful side of the Temple. The Order's most important duty is drawing Life Essence from the Well of Life. They administer the Essence to the Sick and Wounded of Dernas, and they throw the bodies of those about to die *into* the well to avoid the rise of Deathless. Their least public, but most *significant*, duty is as the City's Administrative Class. They maintain the city's genealogical records, sign off on work orders, and see to it that the city's craftsmen and laborers are supplied with raw materials.
>
> The Order of War is a brotherhood of Warriors, the finest in Amalah. There are rarely more than fifty members of the Order living within the Temple at any given time. They are given a cup of Life Essence to drink every morning. They then spend the majority of their day *training* for war. Their Training Routine is intense enough that it would kill any mortal man, and includes sparring with sharpened weapons and *barely* pulling strikes. The Order's daily dosage of Life Essence allows their bodies to push through the agonizing trials, and recover in time to do it again the next day. They are known for their *calmness* in battle, for their training has rid them of the fear of death and pain. They battle in silence, calmly and efficiently slaughtering their enemies.

The Order of Life trades with the City-State's Farmers and Tribal Hunters, exchanging Life Essence for food. They also trade the Essence for other resources, such as raw metals and timber, necessary to fuel the city's construction, expansion, and maintenance. A vial of the Essence can be the difference between life and death for a hunter, for it can allow the body to recover from otherwise deadly wounds. It is even more valuable to a Farmer, who can sprinkle the Essence upon their fields and multiply their crop four-fold.

The City's Residents, Specialists and Laborers alike, are cared for by the Temple. Their Food and Supplies are procured by the Temple, secured in Warehouses and allocated in accordance with the Priests' Holy Wisdom. The city is kept in a steady state of expansion. New Housing, Workshops, Warehouses, and *Walls* are constantly being constructed.

The City's Purpose is to hold the Well of Life, and as such the City's Industry is focused upon fueling its war machine. Making advancements in Metallurgy and Craftsmanship win men a place in Song and *Legend* as surely as martial prowess, and Smiths and Bowyers are second only to Warriors in prestige. Architects and Engineers are the next most prestigious professions, for their minds give birth to new fortifications, massive weapons, and other defenses for the Well of Life.

#### The Roads to Gwanyin

Gwanyin's Weakness was also one of its defensive strengths. It was nestled in a Volcanic Caldera... at the top of a very tall Mountian. There were only a handful of roads that could lead a man to the Silroin Caldera, and the City of Gwanyin at its center. Most of them were ancient affairs, unpaved but still *relatively* passable, which circled the mountain's edges and cut through natural caverns on their way up into the caldera. The rest were natural paths. 

This posed a slight *problem* as commerce began to flow up the sides of the mountain. Wear and tear on the paths had caused them to *degrade* over time. If nothing was done, the roads would eventually turn to rubble... and passage would be restricted to the natural paths. Those would grow congested, and in time they would wear away... and rock-slides and avalanches would become serious problems. Repairing and reinforcing the roads was a colossal task for the people of Gwanyin... but it became a priority.

In the meantime, something had to be done to keep the roads open. The solution... was a rough one. Travel up and down the mountain was heavily controlled. The Order of Life's Bureaucrat-Priests worked to figure out *who* should walk *which* road to reach Gwanyin. They took careful accounting of the *weight* of those who traveled, and tried to do their best to send them on paths that could bear them.

The Systems they developed would remain even after the roads were repaired... and would be used to limit damage to the roads and keep the maintenance budget under control.

#### Subject Villages

Gwanyin is not the only settlement in the Silroin Caldera. It has many smaller neighbors, a series of Farming Villages. The City holds sway over these Villages through its two great resources: Life Essence and Warriors.

The City is dependent upon the Villages for food, and it protects them *fiercely*. Any invading force that seeks to raid a Caldera Village is inviting vengeance from Gwanyin. When word of an attack reaches the City, a force of well-trained and well-disciplined soldiers will inevitably be dispatched... generally with a party of five members of the Order of War attached to them.

Likewise, the Villages are dependent upon Gwanyin for the Life Essence. Mixing Life-Essence into the water that irrigates their crops is the *foundation* of the Villagers' rampant success. They trade roughly a quarter of their crop at harvest time, and in exchange the Order of Life will supply them with Life Essence in the Spring. This ensures that their crops are bountiful, allowing them to trade freely with tribes wise enough to *trade* rather than *raid*.

Home to a large community of Gon's Goblin priests, known as the Ranos.

Other settlements/cities include:

### Herding the Masses - The Holy City of Thyval

The Turmoiled of the Red Plains began constructing a citadel, situated near the border of the Wastes, where their ancestors witnessed the very curse that robbed them of their holy land. However, they were near enough that such a city could become their new holy land in its own right.

And so, the Holy City of Thyval was born.

Culture - Thyvians have a heavy cultural emphasis on piety, modesty, and respect towards one another. It is said that their ancestors' debaucherous behavior was the reason for the blight for their destined homeland. Common attire for men and women involve covering the entire body, with long sleeved tunics and robes that reach to their knees being a place holder outfit. Cleanliness is another focus of their culture, with one washing another as a sign of kindness.

Religion - The Thyvians worship a god called the Angel of Purity, a being said to be an exemplar of modesty and respect. Their culture practices a religious philosophy called the Rebuke. This involves a daily denial of the Witch's influence on the city, acknowledging the curses that she rains over them, and a personal declaration of respect and blessings towards others. The priests, called "the Witch's Rejecters", devote themselves to shouting among the streets, denying the Witch every morning and every night.

Government - Thyval is governed by a council called the "Fair Elders", who are voted upon by the residents of the city every 7 years. Within the central spire of the city sits the Erudite Vault, where the Elders meet to consult with each other on governing the city.

### The Magocracy

[Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flua9lf/)

The Magocracy may in future live up to its potential and become the grand nation of magic. But for now they are not more than a primitive tribe with a primitive village led by a shaman. And the caste system only crudely observed.

Though following the Sorcerer's plans the Apokryphes will in time transform their society into the Magocracy, building a nation on the material plane akin to the society of Apokryphs as established in the Rift.

With their caste society having religious and cultural meaning. No caste is higher than another in social standing. They just serve as crude way to determine one's vocation in life. Administration, sciences and works of pure intellect are done by the Philosophers. The Guardians are the defenders of the nation and work in every way the defense of the nation requires from military service and training to espionage and other less unsavory practices of war and politics. The citizens do the day to day work. Although money plays never a large role in the nation. Money is mostly frowned upon and only used to trade with foreigners.. The mages are a casteless part of society involved in all workings their help and presence is needed.

People carry a private name for personal use and a public use-name. People who distinguish themslves are given titles by the leaders of society like The Guardian or The Warrior.

As in the Rift the nation is supposed to be governed by the Inner Council. Where all Apokryphes castes and all cities contribute a councilor. The Circle is lead by the First Councilor whose job it is to break ties in votes. The Circle is advised by the mages

While all forms of art are a trade for the Citizen case the pursuit of art and knowledge in their freetime is encouraged. The masks nearly all citizens wear not only carry marks of their station in society, but can also be customized to a degree and are the prime opportunity for Apokryphs to show their artistic skills.

The nations of the Apokryphs have in many worlds left their mark by being the biggest exporters of enchanted wares and no one says they can not do it again.

#### Epoidos and The White Gates

On the Kiln islands there is a patch of Rift Wood. It's Rift Trees have been carved into the shape of a gateway. On the hinges of this gateway are two heavy white gates. These gates are the only entrance from the prime material plane to the Sleeping City in the Rift.

So it should not come as a surprise that around these gates a settlement of Apokryphs have collected. Worshipping the Sorcerer they founded the city of Epoidos here to guard these gates to the afterlife.

While there is not yet much magic to study the Sorcerer intended for this town to become the worlds premiere center of magical learning. The town where the knowledge of everything magical in this world is kept. A veritable holy land of the Sorcerer, where those wanting to learn his teaching can flock together.

The Hunting Grounds were the ancestral home of humanity. Made by Rictus and traveled by his people under the guidance of the Iron Judges it was home to many nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes of humans, using the magical arrows Rictus had given their forefathers to hunt.

Their is however one town where the Iron Judges meet to deliberate on recent events, religious matters and tribal business. The place is called Sanctuary. Where outside the tribes often squabble over the best places to hunt, sources of water or the best trees to make arrows from in Sanctuary the Iron Law reigns supreme and no one dares to break the law given to humanity by their creator and patron Rictus.

It is no one wonder then that the center of worship for Rictus is also Sanctuary. The people of Sanctuary try to live by the Iron Law and try to educate visitors on the Iron Law in accordance with the teachings of Rictus. The town of Sanctury is the holy land of Rictus.

The oldest of these was the Society of the Sting, those human and yashool who showed Fidelity to the scorpion. These were the men responsible for eating the Unliving, an unpleasant, but honored task to control their unbearable competition. In the forest, great respect was shown to the ravens for their supernatural intelligence. The most elite human and yashool were initiated into the Society of the Black Wing. They would make elaborate feathered costumes and beaked masks to dance Fidelity to the raven. In the jungle, the Bearcat was king because of its supernatural strength. The elite, human and yashool, in their respective tribes, joined the Society of the Whisker, fashioning costumes and dancing Fidelity to gain an increment of this physical power.
