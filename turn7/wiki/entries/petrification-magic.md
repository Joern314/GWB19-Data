This required the caster to take in the magic from an unliving creature who had been put down and redirect that energy to their target.

Petrification magic was not instant and could only be used from a short distance, but the living/unliving would slowly turn to stone from the point that the magic was directed to, until they had been rendered into nothing more than a statue. This spell does not permit this to be undone. To prevent becoming a statue, one must rid themselves of all of the parts that have started to turn to stone.
