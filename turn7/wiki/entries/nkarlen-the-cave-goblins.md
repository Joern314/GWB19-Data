# Nkarlen, the Cave Goblins [Mortal Races]

The Nkarlen are a race of four to five feet tall agile pointy-eared humanoids with crooked noses and angry looking eyes. They are extreme omnivores and will attempt to eat anything and everything. They have incredibly strong teeth and stomach acid and can therefore eat even small rocks. Created by a god of vengeance, they have a tendency to never forget even the smallest slight. When this is combined with their natural lack of sympathy, they can become hell-bent on payback. They are short-lived - their average max life span is only 40 years - but they breed like rabbits; it is common for one pair of goblins to have ten to twelve children.

They have a naturally agile and skinny physique allowing them to slip through their caves and holes quickly. Their skin is usually a mottled gray/brown, but extended exposure to light turns them green. Those goblins who never leave their caves often develop darker brown skin to the point where it is almost black. Their voices usually range from shrill to guttural with nothing in between. Goblins with normal voices are rare.
