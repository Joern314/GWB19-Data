They were small things, the adults only the size of a small wolf, and covered with a thin coating of fur. A sleek design, reminiscent of sharks, better for swimming in the water. Gills, so as to breath under the sea, a proper set of lungs, so as to breath the air while on land.

The tail was long, turning into a proper tail-fin, and the paws had to be changed a bit. Wider gaps between the toes, with some webbing between them to further assist in the water. Sharp claws, not unlike a cat, and sharper teeth would let it hunt in the water.

Smaller fins were placed on forelegs and hind legs, just above the elbow/knee joint completed the look.
