Description: The Thyvians are the descendants of the Turmoiled tribe, down in the western reaches of the Blood Plains and right on the border of the Wastes of Pain.

**Culture** - Thyvians have a heavy cultural emphasis on piety, modesty, and respect towards one another. It is said that their ancestors' debaucherous behavior was the reason for the blight for their destined homeland. Common attire for men and women involve covering the entire body, with long sleeved tunics and robes that reach to their knees being a place holder outfit. Cleanliness is another focus of their culture, with one washing another as a sign of kindness.

**Religion** - The Thyvians worship a goddess called the Angel of Purity, a being said to be an exemplar of modesty and respect. Their culture practices a religious philosophy called the Rebuke. This involves a daily denial of the Witch's influence on the city, acknowledging the curses that she rains over them, and a personal declaration of respect and blessings towards others. The priests, called "the Witch's Rejecters", devote themselves to shouting among the streets, denying the Witch every morning and every night. Over their faces sit a clean slate mask with their light blue robes.

**Government** - Thyval is governed by a council called the "Fair Elders", who are voted upon by the residents of the city every 7 years. Within the central spire of the city sits the Erudite Vault, where the Elders meet to consult with each other on governing the city.
