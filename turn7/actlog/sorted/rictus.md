>###Crisis: Heresy I
>
>The people of the Hunting Grounds and Sanctuary knew that indeed Rictus only considered one thing real heresy – subversion and perversion of the Iron Law. And to resolve these issues the Iron Inquisition and the Lawbringers existed. 
>
>Religion was not bound to the Iron Law. People were free to believe in what they wanted, as long as they adhered to the tenants and rules of the Iron Law.
>
>###Crisis: Like Vermin I
>
>The tribes of the Hunting Grounds know only to hunt what they need. And since all the magic they know is either not useful to the public, aside from hunting, there is not that much sacrifice for magic going on.
>
>In fact most of the supernatural powers of the humans are based on the miracles of the Iron Law and the Waidmänner, which do not need any magical energies to sustain themselves. So the problems of the rest of the world, were not the problems of humanity.
>
>###Prompt: The Invisible Silk Roads + Prompt: A Purely Mortal Struggle II
>
>From the Kiln Island the most daring of traders brought Kindlscal metal to the Hunting Grounds. The metal was priced by humans for their use in lamps and easy to find arrow heads. Two very useful things for a culture of mostly nomadic tribes hunting in a great forest. 
>
>The traders of Sanctuary, mostly Waidmänner on a hunting quest braving the wider world, had founded a village on the Kiln Islands. Hute was a very small village, but it served the Waidmänner traveling between the Islands and Sanctuary as home away from home.
>
>In fact the whole venture had been started by Udeis. In Sanctuary he had been the best of thieves and a criminal mastermind. But he did see the chance for even greater profit.
>
>The followers of Lyva mainly consisted of trade obsessed merchants and craftspeople obsessed with magic. So arriving with the delegation of Iron Judges Udeis operated under the guise of their honesty, but regularly availed himself products, produced by the people of the Kiln Islands, and no one ever suspected the loyal followers of the god of law.
>
>So Udeis made a fortune while hiding his stolen goods trade and often undercutting the prices of the legitimate traders back home because of The Iron Judges often developed a propsenity to keep out of trade disputes and let the traders figure out the intricacies of trade themselves.
