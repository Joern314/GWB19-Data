>The Priests of the Order of Life were the first to *realize* the danger that Magic posed to their food supply. They also knew that they couldn't lose the advantage that came from the Rune-Enchantments upon their Defenders' Armor and Weapons. Thus... the Order of Life was presented with a Battlefield suited for their particular talents and tools. It was a Logistical Battle, and the Priest-Bureaucrats of the Order of Life spent their lives fighting such battles.
>
>The initial fix was a simple one, a patch-job meant to minimize damage until a more permanent solution could be conceived of and implemented. The Slaughter of Animals for food within the walls of Gwanyin was the sole province of the City's Butchers. It was relatively easy for the Priests to arrange cooperation between the Butchers and the Mages, allowing the Mages to charge the Runic Enchantments upon the City's Weapons more freely. As this was the primary use of Magic in Gwanyin, this worked as a stopgap solution.
>
>A Detachment of Priest-Bureaucrats were dispatched to Audit the City's Magic-Users. They were to assess the number of Animals that needed to be killed to fuel the City's Magical Economy, and devise a method to estimate the annual growth rate. This was relatively simple in the case of Magic Items, but a bit of a challenge regarding other forms of magic. Still, it took them only a few years to gather enough information to build a solid calculation upon.
>
>The Temple Bureaucracy then set about the business of building a Supply Chain for Dernas's Magic Users. They arranged for Food to be grown, Livestock to be raised, and special Markets to be setup for the sale of Sacrificial Animals. The Purchase of Sacrificial Animals was a privilege reserved to the City's Mages, who had to acquire a License from the Temple of Life to purchase their Sacrificial Animals.
>
>The Temple then placed modest fines upon Magic Users that used Non-Sacrificial Animals outside of an emergency. This ordinance was difficult to enforce. However, it had just enough teeth to produce an artificial division between the Sacrificial Animal Market and the Food Animal Market. This insulated the Food Supply from being unduly influenced by the Mages' practice.
>
>[We've resolved the crisis through bureaucracy.]
>
>[There's now a complex economic construct dedicated to mass-producing chickens, goats, and other sacrificial animals for use by Mages. Since most of those Animals can still be used for food *after* the Mage is done with them, this shouldn't have too many unfortunate side effects.]

[Heresy](

>#Heresy

>Mair was **normally** the type of Divinity that liked to let their followers deal with their problems on their own. The God of War was happy to give them the strength they needed and show them what direction to travel along, but Mair wouldn't fight their battles for them. Truth would be found through debate or through battle, as viewpoints clashed with one-another (metaphorically or not) as was proper.
>
>*Then* Mair's Worshipers started treating the God of War and Life as a Divine Authority, and began to threaten Mair's displeasure upon those who would not follow their way. It became clear to Mair that some ground rules needed to be set... and that they needed to be set on a large scale.
>
>Thus, Mair reached out to the Faithful and sent a strongly worded dream to her Clergy. The dream clarified Mair's position on contentious issues, laid down Mair's actual philosophy, and gave a vivid description of what The God of Life could *and would* do to the genitals of anyone who continued to put words in its mouth.
>
>For some reason, people responded more strongly to threats of genital mutilation than they did to death threats. That threat would persist among Mair's Clergy for generations, and be immortalized in written scriptures.
>
>[-1 Act to Contact my Clergy, and explain that they're worshiping a War God that doesn't really care about their petty issues.]
>
>[Also, I pulled a Dionysis and threatened to do horrific things to everyone's junk if they kept dragging my name into their arguments. This should restore orthodoxy for awhile.]
>
>> *Basic Overview of Mair's Tenets:*
>
>> Be Prepared for the Struggle for Survival. Danger will come to you in time.
>
>> Resolve your Differences through Conflict. Face each-other in the open, and do not let spite and grudges fester.
>
>> Debate is an Honorable Battlefield. Respect the Consensus that forms, but do not be afraid to revisit an issue.
>
>> Cry out to the Gods for Strength, not for Salvation. We are but Guides. We cannot walk your Path or fight your Battles for you.
>
>> Seek Challenges and grow your Strength, but do not waste your life. A Dead Warrior is of no good to anyone.
>
>> Choose your Battlefields well, and choose your Moment *better*. Strength and Training win fights, but Discretion and Foresight win Battles.

[A Mortal Struggle](

>#The Guilds of Gwanyin
>
>[A Purely Mortal Struggle]
>
>Aran spent his life *changing* the Society of Gwanyin.
>
>Aran spent his life *championing* an Idea. Without the Craftsmen who built their weapons and armor, the City's Warriors would be unable to defend it. Thus, it was clear that the Craftsmen were of equal importance to the Warriors as neither could stand for long without the other. Thus, wasn't it only fair that the Craftsmen be granted respect and honors akin to those granted to warriors?
>
>Aran convinced many that the Craftsmen of the City should have Honorable Orders, like the Order of War. The Order of War served a crucial purpose in the development of the City's Warriors. The Champions of the Order *trained* the common soldiers and the levies. They elevated the finest warriors to the Lesser Order of War, so that they could be prepared for the Honor of being elevated to the Order itself. Surely the Craftsmen deserved something similar?
>
>Thus... the Craftsman's Guilds were founded. At first they were simple Social Clubs, places where members of the same Trade could gather to socialize. Familiarity was born from these quiet meetings, and that Familiarity grew into trust. Trust grew into Friendship, and Friendships grew into Alliances. The Guilds' Members began to work together to set standards of quality and *payment* among their members.
>
>Eventually, the Order of Life was forced to recognize the Guilds' Authority over their Trades. This was not wholly a bad thing. The Order of Life was able to offload much of its Bureaucratic Labor onto the Guilds... freeing up the Priest-Bureaucrats for other concerns. This had the *peculiar* effect of significantly decentralizing the Economy... necessitating a standard of trade other than Life Essence.
>
>---
>
>Metals were the clear candidate for a currency. However, there were serious problems with this approach. It was difficult to establish relative value between the metals, it was even harder to ensure that a lump of metal was pure, and it was relatively common for a merchant to refuse payment in one metal or another.
>
>This problem was resolved by the Guild of Silversmiths. They produced a series of Coins of uniform weight and design, and guaranteed purity. They also setup an exchange rate internally between the metal coins, which they adjusted periodically at regular intervals. This allowed them to implement a functional currency for Gwanyin.

[Invisible Silk Roads](

>#Invisible Roads between Warring States
>
>Suffice it to say, the Vengeful and the People of Dernas do not trade with each-other directly. There is much bad blood between the states. However, The Life Essence flows to The Vengeful *anyway*. Once The Essence is beyond Dernas's direct influence, it flows along the Trade-Routes like any other commodity. 
>
>Much of the Life Essence that goes to the Vengeful in their Jungle moves through a relatively innocuous small fishing village on the border of the Goblin Lands, known as Freeport. The People of the Village make their living from the sea, but they earn their luxuries from the use of their harbor. Theirs is a safe harbor in dangerous lands... in part because they are followers of the War Gods.
>
>Freeport knows Mair as the God of Life who sends forth the Essence. It knows the Black Lady who reigns over War, Strength, and Suffering. They know the Red God, whose rituals bring them the strength they need to hold firm against the Goblin Hordes.
>
>The People of the Village do not have the Paranoia of Gwanyin. However, they do dedicate themselves to the maintenance of their palisade walls. This is meant to blunt the attack of Goblin Hordes that manage to slip past Freeport's Watchful Sentries. The majority of the Goblins are kept at by by the Free Riders, who hunt Goblins that get too close to the city... and occasionally send Goblin Slaves south to Redgash.
>
>The Village does its best to avoid the ire of Redgash. Its value in keeping the Life Essence flowing might be reason enough for the Vengeful and their Vampire King to leave the settlement alone. Freeport keeps hold of its independence by sending gifts to Redgash every year. They are small gifts, groups of Goblin Slaves and tribute of Essence, but they are meant to appease the Vengeful.

>[/u/plintstorm, feel free to describe what trade goods flow back to Gwanyin from your people through these intermediaries.]

[The Life Geyser](

>#The Overflow of Life
>
>It became clear to the Priests of the Order of Life that The Well of Life was growing stronger. The Vortex had been steadily growing quicker, and as such they had been able to harvest the Life Essence far more quickly than usual. The Priests largely saw this as a good thing... but they all feared that it was a herald of something worse yet to come. 
>
>After all, Mair gave men the strength to fight their own battles... and Mair was sending them *a lot* of Life Essence. Thus, the Order of Life began to prepare for some unexpected disaster... never suspecting that it would come from the Well itself.
>
>The Well Erupted for the first time in Mortal Memory, sending up a Miles-High Geyser of Life Essence. The Essence began to rain down upon the World in its liquid form... and in its far more concentrated Crystalline Form. The Geyser's bounty fell upon Amlah, The Goblin Lands, and the edges of the Prismatic Plains and adjacent Jungle on the distant continent. Its effects on the Ocean in the middle were difficult to measure.
>
>The Liquid Life Essence had its usual effects upon the Soil... acting as a powerful fertilizing agent. Farmers and Gatherers would record unprecedented yields within the first year after the Geyser's Eruption. Those who were rained upon by the Essence would enjoy its healing effects. Those who had Rain-Buckets or Bird Baths made of stone would find an amazing discovery... Life Essence floating atop them. Nobody got much... but a few mouthfuls of the Essence were incredibly valuable.
>
>The Crystalline Life Essence had an effect familiar to the residents of the Great Forest. It had fallen to their lands before, when the Comet Shard had finally fallen to the surface. Animals were drawn to the Crystals, and mutated into Dire Creatures when they consumed it.
>
>The world was a bit more dangerous now.
>
>[-13 Acts for the Life-Geyser Cycle Continental Metaphysics.]
>
>> The Geyser erupts once a turn. Some Turns will have mild eruptions, and some turns will have major eruptions. The larger the Eruption, the more Essence will fall upon the world and the larger the Crystals will be.
>
>> The Geysers scatter Life Essence in its Liquid Form across the entire effected area.
>
>> The Geysers scatter Life Essence Crystals across the entire effected area, but the Crystals grow smaller as you get further from the Well of Life. Thus, the largest and nastiest Dire Animals spawn in Amlah.
>
>> The Geysers scatter Liquid Life Essence, which will increase Crop Growth within the affected area.
>
>[-3 Acts for Crystaline Life Essence.]
>
>> Consuming Crystaline Life Essence results in a creature mutating into a "Dire" version of itself. These creatures are larger, more aggressive, and their natural weapons/defenses grow more potent.
>
>> Mortals that consume Crystaline Life Essence experience rapid muscle and bone growth, enlarging them. They may also develop claws, talons, shark-like jaws, or other natural weapons. 
>
>> Consuming too much Crystaline Life Essence will result in a creature growing too large to survive. They will die by one of three causes: Their Heart becoming unable to pump blood through their entire body, their skin splitting open and infection setting in, or their bones crumbling beneath their own weight.
