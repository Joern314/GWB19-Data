>###Crisis: Heresy I
>
>As the Sorcerer was off performing his experiments with magic in  the Amalahan civil war and thereafter against the vampire crusade, many bad habits spread throughout the city of Epoidos.
>
>Different groups of people tried to abolish the caste system, convince the Apokryphs that their magic was meant for conquering the world or just lapsed in their duties in society. 
>
>The Inner Council, the ruling instrument of traditional Apokryph society, however managed to preserve the caste system and the Sorcerer's values. They did this by way of arresting and condemning the heretics. For there was another problem brewing.
>
>###Crisis: Like Vermin I
>
>The magic was in high demand and stocks of animals were dwindling. Magic was the one thing however the people of Epoidos were best at and that they had to share with the world.
>
>The Inncer Council decided to solve this problem by condemning heretics to death. Using their magical energies to fuel the magic of Epoidos and at the same time reducing those consuming magic in the city.
>
>As the Sorcerer heard their prayers from afar, and detected many souls going to the Rift, he returned and was appalled.
>
>To allow mortals to learn from the past and that and how society had functioned before magic, the Sorcerer in the guise of the Vir Sacra taught the people of Epoidos necromancy. He summoned the spirits of the long dead and had them confirm the worth of hard work in comparison with using magic for every little thing.
>
>And thus the number of magic and spells used in Epoidos receded massively.
>
>###Prompt: A Purely Mortal Struggle II
>
>Yrdin the hunter in his “exile” in the hunting grounds learned about the mistreatment of the “heretics” and the atrocities the Inner Council was comiting. Yrdin's goal had been to join the caste of Guardians and prove that he was a warrior. 
>
>But thinking about his family and their safety he realized. It was not more warriors the city of Epoidos needed. And so he had changed his goal from becoming a warrior to becoming an Iron Judge. And he succeded by showing and proving devotion to the Iron Law.
>
>He returned to Epoidos and found those given the powers of Iron Judges and demonstrating their mandate given by the god of law. The Inner Council appointed him to the caste of Philosophers to serve as a moral backbone to the ruling class.
>
>###Prompt: The Invisible Silk Roads
>
>With the “prophet” of the Sorcerer acclaiming the Iron Law as the Law to follow within the boundaries of Apokryph-society the people of Epoidos had awakened interest in Rictus and his laws. And so beyond the mercenary and hunting services they imported the magics of Sanctuary, in as far as the citizens of the Rictus' city shared them.
>
>An exchange of culture started to form. And out of the mages of Epoidos and the followers of Rictus the Wayfarers emerged. A sect of believers in both the Sorcerer and Rictus, who strove to help wanderers on the road and secure the routes of trade.
