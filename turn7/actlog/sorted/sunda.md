>"FOOLS!" Sunda was *not impressed* with the mortals that claimed to follow him. He was the Wild Lord, his very name was synonymous with nature, and yet these mortals dared defile his lands.
>
>"How dare you take without returning. How dare you plunder the wilds so." He growled, stepping towards the crowd that had gathered in the burgeoning city. It wasn't far from Sunda-Tor, north-east a short ways to be precise. He had watched them, and he was not impressed by what he saw.
>
>"Here my words now, and listen: You must give back to the lands, you must not simply take. Give more than is given to you. These are my words to you now, follow them."
>
>And so he left, vanishing in a crash of thunder.

[\-2, contact mortals, Heresy 1 Prompt](

># Heresy 1

>"So many problems these days." Sunda sighed, looking at the squabbling mortals. The small city held an example of an issue he had been working to correct in recent years: mortals getting their stories mixed up.
>
>Poor things couldn't help it of course, they were only mortal. There were two main groups this time, both following warped versions of his supposed desires.
>
>The first group claimed to follow his will, and would lay vengeance upon those that defiled the wilds. A noble goal, but he had never asked for vengeance of any sort.
>
>The second group was equally wrong, proclaiming that it was his intent that they hide away the wilds so that they may be preserved forever.
>
>Both, as mentioned, were *wrong*. The wilds were there to be seen, heard, experienced. Those that harmed the wilds should be punished, yes, but only those that did so without thought.
>
>He came to them, ensuring that his true will was known and understood, and promised that he would punish those that misinterpreted his wants again.
