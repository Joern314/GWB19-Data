[Crisis: Heresy I, -2 contact mortals, Crisis: Like Vermin, +3 for Silk Road Prompt](

>**Heresy Crisis I: The Stone Inquisition**
>
>A rift between factions in the Nkarlen religions threatened to destabilize the faith and breed a civil war in the goblin homelands. 
>
>To control this potential for chaotic anarchy, Gon contacted all of his worshipers, choosing to appear without the clawed hand for the time being. He dictated to them a set of rules, declaring that only the Ranos and the Jikzek that sat on the stone throne had full religious authority and were thereby to enforce these rules. He declared to all of them that those who stray from these rules are to be punished by being sent to work in the deepest and most dangerous mines. Any who inflicted harm in the name of religion on another goblin were to have the same harm done to them three times over as payment.
>
>The portion of the Ranos that managed these operations became known as The Stone Inquisition.
>
>\[-2 contact mortals. Have no idea if this will work at all, but I figured if I condense the violence into organized violence it would be better than complete civil war. It doesn't make sense to me to stop all violence when that's kinda part of the goblin's culture.\]
>
>...
>
>**Like Vermin Crisis I: The Pits**
>
>The goblins solution to the dwindling supply of unliving creatures to supply magic for their gem weaving and petrification magics, was as brutal as it was efficient. The Nkarlen bred and died at a rate exceeding all other mortals, so the Misrei set up collection services for those who had become unliving or for those nearing death. The would collect up groups of them into deep pits and, using expert slingers, kill them off to fill nearby oxeblas crystals to the max which they then transfer to the mages in straw/grass filled boxes very carefully. They also restricted access to the learning of many of the spells for the lower levels of the Misrei.
>
>This would help counteract the problem of running out of unliving animals and give the Misrei more power. The goblins, made with little sympathy, seemed to consider such actions as a wise use of what would otherwise be a wasted resource.
>
>...
>
>**Invisible Silk Roads**
>
>While the Nkarlen didn't have ships to properly trade with anyone overseas, they traded fine Gems to both the neighboring jumbled, who they found curious more than anything, and on occasion to merchants of Amalah who would visit the nearest goblin city of Mukzek about halfway between the goblin capital and largest gem production center of Kzivo'gbamo. Here they exchanged gems for the goods of Amalah.
>
>The mixture of cultures, with Amalah having tales of men fighting until they could fight no more becoming stronger. The goblins upon hearing these tales, set up fight pits with battles to the near undeath. It was brutal combat, but unfortunately it didn't work quite the same way as it did in Amalah. The sport lasted however and many fighting competitions drew fairly significant crowds, with some goblins, turning to worship the divine of Amalah. This also lead to betting and a class of goblins warriors that the two Misrei were quick to dominate.
>
>Eventually this restructuring of the Misrei spread leading to the formation of a new rank, the Saldeol, who acted almost like a local militia and the Misrei's enforcers. These were usually promoted from the most vicious or effective and loyal of the lower levels.

[\-5 for the Nephite Moon (Gloon'srikzo)](

>Gon, having been on top of Lyva, was not only caught up in as much of the explosion as she was, but what remained of him was blown way off of the sun since the force came from underneath him.
>
>When he came to, he found himself facing the sun on the surface of a moon made completely out of nephrite between himself and the planet he called Ranosken below. The sudden appearance of this moon causing an eclipse. Though he didn't realize immediately that he had made it to catch himself from the explosion, Gon appreciated having a place to lay down for a moment. He was dead tired for some reason. Slowly his mind cleared up and he vaguely remembered fighting with... a dragon?
>
>"Lyva..." He groaned as he remembered and craned his neck to look around and his tail thumped against the surface of the moon unbidden.
>
>"Tail?" He muttered out loud in surprise as he looked down at himself. He was covered in black scales that had closed up older wounds and green scales made apparently out of the same material as the surrounding moon, while   
>white veins of quartz marked all of his previous scars. How long had he been out? As best he could figure, he must have used the moon to piece himself back together. After...
>
>"LYVA!!!"
>
>"Kzzzizzzaal nkeliil... Gotta get... UP! Kzzz'man, Nkan." He growled as he scrambled and scraped at the ground with the claws and hands on both feet, trying to get up and balance himself in this strange new form. After a moment of unsteadiness he managed to get up and craned his neck around as the stone feathers that accented his head, arms, spine, and tail stood on end. With great trouble he expanded his his senses... she wasn't on any stone... where...
>
>Coughing up a little molten blood between his sharp teeth, he wiped the side of his muzzle with a clawed hand. *Muzzle?* This was not the time for such questions he convinced himself, and adjusted to reach out again. It was faint, but he could make it out. He took a few clumsy steps to the left, then right, looking to get the trajectory right, before crouching low with a severe growl of pain. He wasn't sure he could use the lava blades to propel himself again, and teleporting... hell, he was just having trouble standing.
>
>"Keep it togetherrr, body... jussst forrr a bit." He breathed as he summoned up the strength of the moon beneath him for a mighty leap towards where he sensed Lyva.
>
>Having located her, he attempted to collect as much of her up as he could and using all most all of what energy he had left teleported the two of them to her room in the tower on the moon, expecting, but not knowing for certain, that she would have stuff stashed their to eat and recover from her damage.
>
>As tired as he was, his teleport was not the best and he basically appeared in mid air and crash landed on his back, coughing up some more lava-blood, before managing to put her on a bed. With a small laugh, he turned to leave.
>
>"We can sssorrrt out who won laterrr." Gon muttered, but then as he tried to take another step it all caught back up with him; the teleport had been too much too soon, and he wavered, stumbled forward, laughed, coughed up some more blood, and collapsed into unconsciousness once more.
>
>\[-5 for the Nephite Moon (Gloon'srikzo). Nephite is a form of jade, so this moon is  a bright green. It is in a different orbit than the other moon and passes in front of the sun to create eclipses occasionally.\]

[\+3 for mortal prompt, -6 for goblin vampire bloodline: Dealego](

>**A Purely Mortal Struggle: Dealego the Bloody**
>
>Part 2: Blood on the Stones
>
>Dealego's vengeance was swift. Nkarlen had little time in their lives for hesitation. Using his knowledge of the major players in the Milerlo Misrei and those close to them, he sought out the less connected members and killed the or tortured them in the twisting side caves of Kzivo'gbamo. As the murders continued, Dealego started to enjoy the process of killing them, of watching their blood drain from their throats after he slit them.
>
>With the rumours circulating of blood drinking coming from the south, it was perhaps only a matter of time until he started trying to become stronger by drinking blood from his victims; he wanted the power, no, he *needed* the power to destroy the Misrei in the open. Killing them one by one was far to slow.
>
>His caves slowly became a bloody mess as Dealego started worshiping the flayed god and sacrificed more and more goblins to him, as he switched to knocking them out and dragging them back to his caves. He even started making clothing and hats from their skins.
>
>He escaped the wrath of the inhabitants only because of the ongoing inquistion and the infighting among the Misrei, as they were happy to make use of the trouble facing the Milerlo Misrei to expand their influence.
>
>It was all a bit short sighted when Dealego managed to gather a whole fanatic group to his cause, rounded up the main family in charge of the Milerlo, and sacrificed them in a ritual in his secret hideout, becoming the first goblin vampire with a mouth viscous flesh ripping teeth.
>
>\[-6 for Dealego bloodline: -3 for blood bond - others that are in contact with blood from this bloodline suffer wounds equivalent to the ones inflicted on the vampire from who the blood originates. -3 for feral blood - the scent of blood from these vampires' blood slowly drives others not of this bloodline into a feral state of pure aggression without reason.\]
