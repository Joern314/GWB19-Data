<p>##A Purely Mortal Struggle II</p>
<p>Raldric had been training.<br />
He was using Blood empowerment more and more than ever, he was a champion of Redgash.<br />
He, however, unlike all the other champions, refused the gift of the Red God, vampirism.</p>
<p>He felt he could only be worthy if the Red God spoke to him, or if he performed a mighty deed. a Deed that no one could ever foresee.</p>
<p>The blood empowerment had made him mighty strong.<br />
He could punch the mighty beasts of the jungle, killing them in a single blow.</p>
<p>But he felt he needed more. And the call of war had come.</p>
<p>[/u/andrewjamesdrake, Raldric might show up in the war and be a full on badass]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>##Crisis: Like Vermin I</p>
<p>The Blood Riders had no such problem, they used very little magic, praticly speaking only Blood Empowerment. And anytime they killed a deer or horse they got magical blood to use.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Vengeful however had such a problem.<br />
They had heavy usage of Blood Empowerment they used meant a lot of sacrifices was needed.</p>
<p>They solve this mostly by killing their goblins slaves, that of course, lead to them needing more slaves.</p>
<p>A slave guild started to appear, these warriors specialized in gathering goblin slaves from all sources they can. Traps, assault and the like.</p>
<p>The Vengeful in their city of Redgash was very damaging, a constant stream of slaves are needed for them.</p>
<hr />
<p>##The Invisible Silk Roads</p>
<p>One of the blood riders tribes, half way to the forest where the rangers live.<br />
They were one of the few tribes that were somewhat half-friendly with the forest men.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they even traded with them. Sometimes, a trader comes from them, maybe from land far away to buy their horses.</p>
<p>The tribe had developed a habit of fighting other tribes for their horses to trade them.</p>
<p>They had heard ideas coming from the forest people, the idea of ‘law’.<br />
Most of it was rubbish of course.</p>
<p>But some of them started to adopt a code of honor, the idea of procedure for things.<br />
Of course, that was only for them, outsiders had no such protection.</p>

<p>##Crisis: Heresy I</p>
<p>The Vengeful was getting uneasy. Some were talking if they should try to return to Amalah, or take up new ways again.</p>
<p>Derak, the Vampire Lord of Redgash knew something would be needed. Having his new army tear itself apart would hardly make a good army, they need to survive until they reach Amalah so they can take it after all.</p>
<p>Derak was unease about the Red God, for he had pointed him in the right direction and obviously would not be fond if he failed, he was almost afraid of the Red God.<br />
Then, one day, he found a blade. The blade was of exeptional quality, with the name <em>Ras</em> engraved on it.</p>
<p>Derak had a smith look over the blade but the smith could not lift the blade. Only Derak could.</p>
<p>Derak did what he does best and loudly declared the time had come for the sword. He had been given a holy blade, one only he could wield.<br />
They would gather arms and take the fight back to Amalah in a Righteous Crusade.</p>
<p>The army gathered, weapons enchanted by followers of the Sorcerers, trained Dinosaurs, some even enchanted as well. Vampires Derak himself had sired to act as his generals, lieutenants and champions.</p>
<p>They set out toward Amalah once more…</p>
<p>[GM: I well the Heresy by focusing them all on a single task, by giving the leader that artifact weapon from the First King</p>
<p>/u/gwydion-drys, battle about to begin.</p>
<p>/u/andrewjamesdrake<br />
How you want this to be done?<br />
rolling to see how far the Bloody Crusade gets? Determine something on discord?</p>
<p>My suggestion:<br />
I give a rough number of strength I think the Vengeful have.<br />
You give a rough number you think the defenders have.<br />
We roll a dice and measure up the result</p>
<p>The Vengeful got… Vampires +1<br />
Blood Enhancement (used by many, not just a small group) +1<br />
Dinosaurs +1<br />
Surprise attack (+1 for first round only, this is after all, the first major attack on Amalah in any living memory)<br />
so +3 (+4 on first roll).</p>
<p>Let’s roll d6 3 times.<br />
if I win 1 roll, the Crusade gets over the first defensive wall (so first fail, second succeed, means the crusade gets over the wall by the second attempt).<br />
More rolls is just how much damage to deals before being driven off.</p>
<p>If we do this, here are my rolls just to speed it along. <a href="https://www.wizards.com/dnd/dice/dice.htm">I use this dice roller, allows you to tag on modifiers right away</a></p>
<p>Roll 1: <strong>6</strong> (2+4)<br />
Roll 2: <strong>9</strong> (6+3)<br />
Roll 3: <strong>8</strong> (5+3)<br />
Yes, I rolled really nicely the 2 last rolls :D ]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>###Crisis: Heresy I</p>
<p>The people of the jumbled mountains had started debating cities, magic and a whole host of other things that made life easier and led to mortals not cherishing life like they should. So in her will to keep them on the right track she made the jumbled Lyva and Glypha had made into her prophet.</p>
<p>The woman with a prehinsile tail made of arms and hands for feet was called Flika. Flika was Glypha’s newest prophet. She sent Flika to the people of the jumbled mountains to remind them of the teachings of Glypha.</p>
<p>###Crisis: Like Vermin I</p>
<p>The jumbled, beyond the odd cantrip, do not know of magic and therefore are not interested in sacrificing animals in masses.</p>
<p>###Prompt: The Invisible Silk Roads</p>
<p>The jumbled primarily imported bodies or parts thereof from the surrounding areas. To that purpose they had created little villages towns of jumbled in the surrounding regions. The jumbled offered to take care of the unliving and often helped the injured and maimed regaining the body parts they had lost in accidents or wars so prevalent to the second continent.</p>
<p>The one thing besides bodies they imported were gems. The jumbled on their mountains lived in the natural caves of the mountain. And they tried to improve the caves with their natural skill at crafts Glypha had taught them. And the gems were a decoration the jumbled normally lacked on their mountains.</p>
<p>So in the little village of jumbled near the goblin territories, jumbled mostly made from goblin parts could be found, giving thanks to Gon Gryn for the gifts of the earth. While still sticking to a simple life routine as herders and flesh knitters if the need arose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Heresy Crisis I: The Stone Inquisition</strong></p>
<p>A rift between factions in the Nkarlen religions threatened to destabilize the faith and breed a civil war in the goblin homelands.</p>
<p>To control this potential for chaotic anarchy, Gon contacted all of his worshipers, choosing to appear without the clawed hand for the time being. He dictated to them a set of rules, declaring that only the Ranos and the Jikzek that sat on the stone throne had full religious authority and were thereby to enforce these rules. He declared to all of them that those who stray from these rules are to be punished by being sent to work in the deepest and most dangerous mines. Any who inflicted harm in the name of religion on another goblin were to have the same harm done to them three times over as payment.</p>
<p>The portion of the Ranos that managed these operations became known as The Stone Inquisition.</p>
<p>[-2 contact mortals. Have no idea if this will work at all, but I figured if I condense the violence into organized violence it would be better than complete civil war. It doesn’t make sense to me to stop all violence when that’s kinda part of the goblin’s culture.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>Like Vermin Crisis I: The Pits</strong></p>
<p>The goblins solution to the dwindling supply of unliving creatures to supply magic for their gem weaving and petrification magics, was as brutal as it was efficient. The Nkarlen bred and died at a rate exceeding all other mortals, so the Misrei set up collection services for those who had become unliving or for those nearing death. The would collect up groups of them into deep pits and, using expert slingers, kill them off to fill nearby oxeblas crystals to the max which they then transfer to the mages in straw/grass filled boxes very carefully. They also restricted access to the learning of many of the spells for the lower levels of the Misrei.</p>
<p>This would help counteract the problem of running out of unliving animals and give the Misrei more power. The goblins, made with little sympathy, seemed to consider such actions as a wise use of what would otherwise be a wasted resource.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>Invisible Silk Roads</strong></p>
<p>While the Nkarlen didn’t have ships to properly trade with anyone overseas, they traded fine Gems to both the neighboring jumbled, who they found curious more than anything, and on occasion to merchants of Amalah who would visit the nearest goblin city of Mukzek about halfway between the goblin capital and largest gem production center of Kzivo’gbamo. Here they exchanged gems for the goods of Amalah.</p>
<p>The mixture of cultures, with Amalah having tales of men fighting until they could fight no more becoming stronger. The goblins upon hearing these tales, set up fight pits with battles to the near undeath. It was brutal combat, but unfortunately it didn’t work quite the same way as it did in Amalah. The sport lasted however and many fighting competitions drew fairly significant crowds, with some goblins, turning to worship the divine of Amalah. This also lead to betting and a class of goblins warriors that the two Misrei were quick to dominate.</p>
<p>Eventually this restructuring of the Misrei spread leading to the formation of a new rank, the Saldeol, who acted almost like a local militia and the Misrei’s enforcers. These were usually promoted from the most vicious or effective and loyal of the lower levels.</p>

<p>Gon, having been on top of Lyva, was not only caught up in as much of the explosion as she was, but what remained of him was blown way off of the sun since the force came from underneath him.</p>
<p>When he came to, he found himself facing the sun on the surface of a moon made completely out of nephrite between himself and the planet he called Ranosken below. The sudden appearance of this moon causing an eclipse. Though he didn’t realize immediately that he had made it to catch himself from the explosion, Gon appreciated having a place to lay down for a moment. He was dead tired for some reason. Slowly his mind cleared up and he vaguely remembered fighting with… a dragon?</p>
<p>“Lyva…” He groaned as he remembered and craned his neck to look around and his tail thumped against the surface of the moon unbidden.</p>
<p>“Tail?” He muttered out loud in surprise as he looked down at himself. He was covered in black scales that had closed up older wounds and green scales made apparently out of the same material as the surrounding moon, while<br />
white veins of quartz marked all of his previous scars. How long had he been out? As best he could figure, he must have used the moon to piece himself back together. After…</p>
<p>“LYVA!!!”</p>
<p>“Kzzzizzzaal nkeliil… Gotta get… UP! Kzzz’man, Nkan.” He growled as he scrambled and scraped at the ground with the claws and hands on both feet, trying to get up and balance himself in this strange new form. After a moment of unsteadiness he managed to get up and craned his neck around as the stone feathers that accented his head, arms, spine, and tail stood on end. With great trouble he expanded his his senses… she wasn’t on any stone… where…</p>
<p>Coughing up a little molten blood between his sharp teeth, he wiped the side of his muzzle with a clawed hand. <em>Muzzle?</em> This was not the time for such questions he convinced himself, and adjusted to reach out again. It was faint, but he could make it out. He took a few clumsy steps to the left, then right, looking to get the trajectory right, before crouching low with a severe growl of pain. He wasn’t sure he could use the lava blades to propel himself again, and teleporting… hell, he was just having trouble standing.</p>
<p>“Keep it togetherrr, body… jussst forrr a bit.” He breathed as he summoned up the strength of the moon beneath him for a mighty leap towards where he sensed Lyva.</p>
<p>Having located her, he attempted to collect as much of her up as he could and using all most all of what energy he had left teleported the two of them to her room in the tower on the moon, expecting, but not knowing for certain, that she would have stuff stashed their to eat and recover from her damage.</p>
<p>As tired as he was, his teleport was not the best and he basically appeared in mid air and crash landed on his back, coughing up some more lava-blood, before managing to put her on a bed. With a small laugh, he turned to leave.</p>
<p>“We can sssorrrt out who won laterrr.” Gon muttered, but then as he tried to take another step it all caught back up with him; the teleport had been too much too soon, and he wavered, stumbled forward, laughed, coughed up some more blood, and collapsed into unconsciousness once more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Purely Mortal Struggle: Dealego the Bloody</strong></p>
<p>Part 2: Blood on the Stones</p>
<p>Dealego’s vengeance was swift. Nkarlen had little time in their lives for hesitation. Using his knowledge of the major players in the Milerlo Misrei and those close to them, he sought out the less connected members and killed the or tortured them in the twisting side caves of Kzivo’gbamo. As the murders continued, Dealego started to enjoy the process of killing them, of watching their blood drain from their throats after he slit them.</p>
<p>With the rumours circulating of blood drinking coming from the south, it was perhaps only a matter of time until he started trying to become stronger by drinking blood from his victims; he wanted the power, no, he <em>needed</em> the power to destroy the Misrei in the open. Killing them one by one was far to slow.</p>
<p>His caves slowly became a bloody mess as Dealego started worshiping the flayed god and sacrificed more and more goblins to him, as he switched to knocking them out and dragging them back to his caves. He even started making clothing and hats from their skins.</p>
<p>He escaped the wrath of the inhabitants only because of the ongoing inquistion and the infighting among the Misrei, as they were happy to make use of the trouble facing the Milerlo Misrei to expand their influence.</p>
<p>It was all a bit short sighted when Dealego managed to gather a whole fanatic group to his cause, rounded up the main family in charge of the Milerlo, and sacrificed them in a ritual in his secret hideout, becoming the first goblin vampire with a mouth viscous flesh ripping teeth.</p>
<p>[-6 for Dealego bloodline: -3 for blood bond - others that are in contact with blood from this bloodline suffer wounds equivalent to the ones inflicted on the vampire from who the blood originates. -3 for feral blood - the scent of blood from these vampires’ blood slowly drives others not of this bloodline into a feral state of pure aggression without reason.]</p>

<li>Protective Duty (Civilians) - If a civilian’s life or freedoms are threatened, a hero or adventurers duty is to ensure their safety.</li>

<p>##The Struggle of Idren II</p>
<p>[Continued from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fv4ovs/endless_pantheon_turn_6/fmmxl5n/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=GodhoodWB&amp;utm_content=t1_fmhy34b">Here</a>]</p>
<p>As Idren aged, he learned to sail on the ships from the island and around the shores of the continent, eventually claiming the ship known as <strong>Caermis</strong> as his own when the sailor above him retired. With the caermis and his crew, he sailed throughout the Kiln Islands and around the peninsulas of the Echoing Jungle. He encountered a great leftover Dire Wolf in the Hunting Grounds and lured it into the river while his archers speared it with javelins. He sailed along the coast of the Red Plains and mocked the riders there, robbing those who set to raid his ship.</p>
<p>It was one of these riders who caught the sailor’s interest. When his arm was cut off, he kept fighting. When he was hurt, he kept fighting. When he was speared through, he unfurled wings and set to fly away. When he was harpooned and pulled down to the ground, he kept snarling and seeking to bite and claw at his captors. The creature in the shape of a man would not die. Idren was fascinated to have an immortal as his “guest”, and interrogated the man on the source of his healing abilities, torturing him and feeding him mere drips of blood until the Vampire’s truth was revealed.</p>
<p>With the knowledge of the vampire’s blessing, Idren burned the creature to ashes and scattered them, before resuming sailing back up the continent, a plan in the making. Spilling vast blood or gaining the favour of an elder Vampire would turn the blessing to him, but the rest of the creatures brood roamed the interior of the plains, far from the shore where Idren was most comfortable. He would have to accrue more men, maybe even an armada in order to enter the plains safely and meet the Elder of the Vampires, or to kill enough to gain it for himself.</p>
<p>At that time, new metalwork was spreading from Bakraftel, a symbol of trade as small bronze tokens, and so Idren set about trading for as much of these as he did. Yet in the process, rumours of potential sailors, other pickpockets and sort he knew well came that they were showing up missing blood in a familiar pattern. Seeking out fellow thieves and gutter rats, Idren discovered another clan of Vampires nestled in the Echoing Jungle’s settlement, preying upon his kind and seducing them. The hunt began anew, as Idren laid traps for their networks, and chased them down in the night, eventually smashing his way in a great house to confront the vampire and demand immortality.</p>
<p>Given the mess he had made, the denial was perhaps not surprising, and soon battle ensued with the man somehow gaining triumph once more.</p>
<p>Seven times Idren hunted down vampires demanding their blessing, and Seven times he was rejected and forced to battle, slaying the spawned fiends with his men.</p>
<p>Clearly their supposed immortality was lacking, and soon the sailor left the shores of the echoing jungle, the story and legend of his deeds, of hunting down these predators, echoing through towns and cities. Though the man himself slowly aged as he wandered far and wide seeking power, the stories and legends of his deeds remained spoken of over and over, becoming something more, something that would never be forgotten.</p>

<p>##Like Vermin and Blood</p>
<p>As Sabin set her routes deep in Bakraftel and the cities of the Echoing Jungle, she created networks of informants and dependants addicted to her blood and goodwill. Unlike those in the south, she kept her mortals alive to feed on them repeatedly and often, choosing the most trustworthy to become her Inheritors and lesser vampires. As they had immortality to spend, it was in their interest to stabilise the region, and so Sabin called on her mistress, the Goddess Lyva to which she was prophet, to help her harness magic better.</p>
<p>Lyva taught her of a better form of trading, of the use of tokens to manage finances, by which mortals could hold onto their livestock more loosely as their wealth as not solely what they possessed. Through Sabin’s contacts, she gathered smiths to produce bronze coins and tokens, and worked to get traders under her thrall to spread them and the system.</p>
<p>Temples were now merged with butcheries in a sense, places were Apokryph priests would kill any and all livestock to harness the magic from them, before the carcasses were passed on to butchers to carve up the meat and sell on. In these places, faith, magic, food and coin were all exchanged, and Lyva found herself favouring them and urging Sabin to help construct more.</p>

<p>The Priests of the Order of Life were the first to <em>realize</em> the danger that Magic posed to their food supply. They also knew that they couldn’t lose the advantage that came from the Rune-Enchantments upon their Defenders’ Armor and Weapons. Thus… the Order of Life was presented with a Battlefield suited for their particular talents and tools. It was a Logistical Battle, and the Priest-Bureaucrats of the Order of Life spent their lives fighting such battles.</p>
<p>The initial fix was a simple one, a patch-job meant to minimize damage until a more permanent solution could be conceived of and implemented. The Slaughter of Animals for food within the walls of Gwanyin was the sole province of the City’s Butchers. It was relatively easy for the Priests to arrange cooperation between the Butchers and the Mages, allowing the Mages to charge the Runic Enchantments upon the City’s Weapons more freely. As this was the primary use of Magic in Gwanyin, this worked as a stopgap solution.</p>
<p>A Detachment of Priest-Bureaucrats were dispatched to Audit the City’s Magic-Users. They were to assess the number of Animals that needed to be killed to fuel the City’s Magical Economy, and devise a method to estimate the annual growth rate. This was relatively simple in the case of Magic Items, but a bit of a challenge regarding other forms of magic. Still, it took them only a few years to gather enough information to build a solid calculation upon.</p>
<p>The Temple Bureaucracy then set about the business of building a Supply Chain for Dernas’s Magic Users. They arranged for Food to be grown, Livestock to be raised, and special Markets to be setup for the sale of Sacrificial Animals. The Purchase of Sacrificial Animals was a privilege reserved to the City’s Mages, who had to acquire a License from the Temple of Life to purchase their Sacrificial Animals.</p>
<p>The Temple then placed modest fines upon Magic Users that used Non-Sacrificial Animals outside of an emergency. This ordinance was difficult to enforce. However, it had just enough teeth to produce an artificial division between the Sacrificial Animal Market and the Food Animal Market. This insulated the Food Supply from being unduly influenced by the Mages’ practice.</p>
<p>[We’ve resolved the crisis through bureaucracy.]</p>
<p>[There’s now a complex economic construct dedicated to mass-producing chickens, goats, and other sacrificial animals for use by Mages. Since most of those Animals can still be used for food <em>after</em> the Mage is done with them, this shouldn’t have too many unfortunate side effects.]</p>

<p>#Heresy</p>
<p>Mair was <strong>normally</strong> the type of Divinity that liked to let their followers deal with their problems on their own. The God of War was happy to give them the strength they needed and show them what direction to travel along, but Mair wouldn’t fight their battles for them. Truth would be found through debate or through battle, as viewpoints clashed with one-another (metaphorically or not) as was proper.</p>
<p><em>Then</em> Mair’s Worshipers started treating the God of War and Life as a Divine Authority, and began to threaten Mair’s displeasure upon those who would not follow their way. It became clear to Mair that some ground rules needed to be set… and that they needed to be set on a large scale.</p>
<p>Thus, Mair reached out to the Faithful and sent a strongly worded dream to her Clergy. The dream clarified Mair’s position on contentious issues, laid down Mair’s actual philosophy, and gave a vivid description of what The God of Life could <em>and would</em> do to the genitals of anyone who continued to put words in its mouth.</p>
<p>For some reason, people responded more strongly to threats of genital mutilation than they did to death threats. That threat would persist among Mair’s Clergy for generations, and be immortalized in written scriptures.</p>

<p>#The Guilds of Gwanyin</p>
<p>[A Purely Mortal Struggle]</p>
<p>Aran spent his life <em>changing</em> the Society of Gwanyin.</p>
<p>Aran spent his life <em>championing</em> an Idea. Without the Craftsmen who built their weapons and armor, the City’s Warriors would be unable to defend it. Thus, it was clear that the Craftsmen were of equal importance to the Warriors as neither could stand for long without the other. Thus, wasn’t it only fair that the Craftsmen be granted respect and honors akin to those granted to warriors?</p>
<p>Aran convinced many that the Craftsmen of the City should have Honorable Orders, like the Order of War. The Order of War served a crucial purpose in the development of the City’s Warriors. The Champions of the Order <em>trained</em> the common soldiers and the levies. They elevated the finest warriors to the Lesser Order of War, so that they could be prepared for the Honor of being elevated to the Order itself. Surely the Craftsmen deserved something similar?</p>
<p>Thus… the Craftsman’s Guilds were founded. At first they were simple Social Clubs, places where members of the same Trade could gather to socialize. Familiarity was born from these quiet meetings, and that Familiarity grew into trust. Trust grew into Friendship, and Friendships grew into Alliances. The Guilds’ Members began to work together to set standards of quality and <em>payment</em> among their members.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Order of Life was forced to recognize the Guilds’ Authority over their Trades. This was not wholly a bad thing. The Order of Life was able to offload much of its Bureaucratic Labor onto the Guilds… freeing up the Priest-Bureaucrats for other concerns. This had the <em>peculiar</em> effect of significantly decentralizing the Economy… necessitating a standard of trade other than Life Essence.</p>
<hr />
<p>Metals were the clear candidate for a currency. However, there were serious problems with this approach. It was difficult to establish relative value between the metals, it was even harder to ensure that a lump of metal was pure, and it was relatively common for a merchant to refuse payment in one metal or another.</p>
<p>This problem was resolved by the Guild of Silversmiths. They produced a series of Coins of uniform weight and design, and guaranteed purity. They also setup an exchange rate internally between the metal coins, which they adjusted periodically at regular intervals. This allowed them to implement a functional currency for Gwanyin.</p>

<p>#Invisible Roads between Warring States</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, the Vengeful and the People of Dernas do not trade with each-other directly. There is much bad blood between the states. However, The Life Essence flows to The Vengeful <em>anyway</em>. Once The Essence is beyond Dernas’s direct influence, it flows along the Trade-Routes like any other commodity.</p>
<p>Much of the Life Essence that goes to the Vengeful in their Jungle moves through a relatively innocuous small fishing village on the border of the Goblin Lands, known as Freeport. The People of the Village make their living from the sea, but they earn their luxuries from the use of their harbor. Theirs is a safe harbor in dangerous lands… in part because they are followers of the War Gods.</p>
<p>Freeport knows Mair as the God of Life who sends forth the Essence. It knows the Black Lady who reigns over War, Strength, and Suffering. They know the Red God, whose rituals bring them the strength they need to hold firm against the Goblin Hordes.</p>
<p>The People of the Village do not have the Paranoia of Gwanyin. However, they do dedicate themselves to the maintenance of their palisade walls. This is meant to blunt the attack of Goblin Hordes that manage to slip past Freeport’s Watchful Sentries. The majority of the Goblins are kept at by by the Free Riders, who hunt Goblins that get too close to the city… and occasionally send Goblin Slaves south to Redgash.</p>
<p>The Village does its best to avoid the ire of Redgash. Its value in keeping the Life Essence flowing might be reason enough for the Vengeful and their Vampire King to leave the settlement alone. Freeport keeps hold of its independence by sending gifts to Redgash every year. They are small gifts, groups of Goblin Slaves and tribute of Essence, but they are meant to appease the Vengeful.</p>

<p>[The Life Geyser](</p>
<blockquote>
<p>#The Overflow of Life</p>
<p>It became clear to the Priests of the Order of Life that The Well of Life was growing stronger. The Vortex had been steadily growing quicker, and as such they had been able to harvest the Life Essence far more quickly than usual. The Priests largely saw this as a good thing… but they all feared that it was a herald of something worse yet to come.</p>
<p>After all, Mair gave men the strength to fight their own battles… and Mair was sending them <em>a lot</em> of Life Essence. Thus, the Order of Life began to prepare for some unexpected disaster… never suspecting that it would come from the Well itself.</p>
<p>The Well Erupted for the first time in Mortal Memory, sending up a Miles-High Geyser of Life Essence. The Essence began to rain down upon the World in its liquid form… and in its far more concentrated Crystalline Form. The Geyser’s bounty fell upon Amlah, The Goblin Lands, and the edges of the Prismatic Plains and adjacent Jungle on the distant continent. Its effects on the Ocean in the middle were difficult to measure.</p>
<p>The Liquid Life Essence had its usual effects upon the Soil… acting as a powerful fertilizing agent. Farmers and Gatherers would record unprecedented yields within the first year after the Geyser’s Eruption. Those who were rained upon by the Essence would enjoy its healing effects. Those who had Rain-Buckets or Bird Baths made of stone would find an amazing discovery… Life Essence floating atop them. Nobody got much… but a few mouthfuls of the Essence were incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>The Crystalline Life Essence had an effect familiar to the residents of the Great Forest. It had fallen to their lands before, when the Comet Shard had finally fallen to the surface. Animals were drawn to the Crystals, and mutated into Dire Creatures when they consumed it.</p>
<p>The world was a bit more dangerous now.</p>
<p>[-13 Acts for the Life-Geyser Cycle Continental Metaphysics.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Geyser erupts once a turn. Some Turns will have mild eruptions, and some turns will have major eruptions. The larger the Eruption, the more Essence will fall upon the world and the larger the Crystals will be.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Geysers scatter Life Essence in its Liquid Form across the entire effected area.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Geysers scatter Life Essence Crystals across the entire effected area, but the Crystals grow smaller as you get further from the Well of Life. Thus, the largest and nastiest Dire Animals spawn in Amlah.</p>

<p>The Geysers scatter Liquid Life Essence, which will increase Crop Growth within the affected area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[-3 Acts for Crystaline Life Essence.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consuming Crystaline Life Essence results in a creature mutating into a “Dire” version of itself. These creatures are larger, more aggressive, and their natural weapons/defenses grow more potent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mortals that consume Crystaline Life Essence experience rapid muscle and bone growth, enlarging them. They may also develop claws, talons, shark-like jaws, or other natural weapons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Malaphet watched his mortals as they fought among themselves with an emotion akin to disappointment filling the portion of his being that was focused upon them, for as they were they would never be capable of serving the role he would come to require of them. And so he reached another tendril down through the clouds to touch the mind of a new Vasari tribesman to make his emissary, anyone would do Malaphet figured and so he reached out to the first one to catch his attention.</p>
<p>Balhom had always felt he was a man destined for great things, greater then the disappointing family he had been born to and greater then the quiet tribe from which he was raised in. Despite his aspirations of grandeur, life had rarely gone his way, he had been set aside as his father’s primary heir in favor of some boy born of his fathers Unliving harem, his friends had cast him aside, claiming he was psychotic while his Mother in her hatred of his father and unable to act upon that turned it upon Balhom. So when he felt a shock run through his mind and a tentacle hanging from the sky next to him he was overwhelmed by a feeling of vindication and renewed conviction.</p>
<p>Malaphet imparted visions of what he wanted from the young man he had selected, how he wanted Balhom to turn his fellows back to the correct path as his prophet. Balhom of course, quickly agreed to this, though in his newly ignited ambition, beseeched Malaphet for more, so that he might better serve the will of his god. Malaphet saw the wisdom of this, just as he saw how the minds of some of his heretical followers had already set their minds to their false beliefs. So from the tip of his dangling tendril he wove a mantle, imbued with a minuscule amount of his power, and drapped it over the shoulders of his new Prophet before withdrawing his tentacle into the night skies.</p>
<p>Balhom quickly set about gathering the people of his village, revealing that their divine Patron had spoken to him. Many were skeptical at first, but the mantle that seemed as if it were carved out of the night sky itself, stars seeming to swirl from within it’s folds. All doubts were blown away when Balhom floated into the sky to hover above them, the cloak billowing in the wind, but now seeming to emit an unearthly glow that draped not only itself but also Balhom in it’s light. After having convinced the village of his status as prophet Balhom began to select those he knew as heretics(it was a small village and word got around, especially to those that nobody cared to guard their tongue.) and he offered them a choice, renounce their heresy, or be forced to experience the First Death by his hand. Many chose to renounce their heresy in favor of Balhom’s display of power.</p>
<p>From there he left, heading to the various villages and proving to them his status as prophet before heading to the island from which their people had first called home, claiming the Prophet Minaera’s temple that had lain empty for the past 250 years since her death. From there he began to fashion a proto-city from which he would rule over the Vasari tribes.</p>

<p>Thyval had a crisis of faith. There were disputes among the city about the Beloved Angel, and who she was in relation to the Witch. Some had claimed that they were once sisters, and they fell out after one chose the profane over sanctity. Some claimed that the Angel and the Witch were cosmic enemies, found at the beginning of time, always warring against one another. And, to Oryllia’s dismay, some had said that they were one in the same, playing a charade to sap up faith.</p>
<p>Oryllia had a plan.</p>
<p>The High Exalter, the Seers of Sanctity, and many attendees had all witnessed a glorious display within the Pearl Temple. The altar was covered in holy fire, and their incense was lapped up by the very flames of the Angel.</p>

<p>###Crisis: Like Vermin I</p>
<p>The tribes of the Hunting Grounds know only to hunt what they need. And since all the magic they know is either not useful to the public, aside from hunting, there is not that much sacrifice for magic going on.</p>
<p>In fact most of the supernatural powers of the humans are based on the miracles of the Iron Law and the Waidmänner, which do not need any magical energies to sustain themselves. So the problems of the rest of the world, were not the problems of humanity.</p>

<p>In fact the whole venture had been started by Udeis. In Sanctuary he had been the best of thieves and a criminal mastermind. But he did see the chance for even greater profit.</p>
<p>The followers of Lyva mainly consisted of trade obsessed merchants and craftspeople obsessed with magic. So arriving with the delegation of Iron Judges Udeis operated under the guise of their honesty, but regularly availed himself products, produced by the people of the Kiln Islands, and no one ever suspected the loyal followers of the god of law.</p>

<p>###Crisis: Heresy I</p>
<p>As the Sorcerer was off performing his experiments with magic in the Amalahan civil war and thereafter against the vampire crusade, many bad habits spread throughout the city of Epoidos.</p>
<p>Different groups of people tried to abolish the caste system, convince the Apokryphs that their magic was meant for conquering the world or just lapsed in their duties in society.</p>
<p>The Inner Council, the ruling instrument of traditional Apokryph society, however managed to preserve the caste system and the Sorcerer’s values. They did this by way of arresting and condemning the heretics. For there was another problem brewing.</p>
<p>###Crisis: Like Vermin I</p>
<p>The magic was in high demand and stocks of animals were dwindling. Magic was the one thing however the people of Epoidos were best at and that they had to share with the world.</p>
<p>The Inncer Council decided to solve this problem by condemning heretics to death. Using their magical energies to fuel the magic of Epoidos and at the same time reducing those consuming magic in the city.</p>
<p>As the Sorcerer heard their prayers from afar, and detected many souls going to the Rift, he returned and was appalled.</p>
<p>To allow mortals to learn from the past and that and how society had functioned before magic, the Sorcerer in the guise of the Vir Sacra taught the people of Epoidos necromancy. He summoned the spirits of the long dead and had them confirm the worth of hard work in comparison with using magic for every little thing.</p>
<p>And thus the number of magic and spells used in Epoidos receded massively.</p>
<p>###Prompt: A Purely Mortal Struggle II</p>
<p>Yrdin the hunter in his “exile” in the hunting grounds learned about the mistreatment of the “heretics” and the atrocities the Inner Council was comiting. Yrdin’s goal had been to join the caste of Guardians and prove that he was a warrior.</p>
<p>But thinking about his family and their safety he realized. It was not more warriors the city of Epoidos needed. And so he had changed his goal from becoming a warrior to becoming an Iron Judge. And he succeded by showing and proving devotion to the Iron Law.</p>
<p>He returned to Epoidos and found those given the powers of Iron Judges and demonstrating their mandate given by the god of law. The Inner Council appointed him to the caste of Philosophers to serve as a moral backbone to the ruling class.</p>
<p>###Prompt: The Invisible Silk Roads</p>
<p>With the “prophet” of the Sorcerer acclaiming the Iron Law as the Law to follow within the boundaries of Apokryph-society the people of Epoidos had awakened interest in Rictus and his laws. And so beyond the mercenary and hunting services they imported the magics of Sanctuary, in as far as the citizens of the Rictus’ city shared them.</p>
<p>An exchange of culture started to form. And out of the mages of Epoidos and the followers of Rictus the Wayfarers emerged. A sect of believers in both the Sorcerer and Rictus, who strove to help wanderers on the road and secure the routes of trade.</p>

<p>“without an atmosphere this is no place for music, but that won’t stop me from dancing.”</p>
<p>He dug his claws into the earth and pulled up a modest red-rock amphitheater from the ground. The front row contained spectator boxes with 18 thrones, one for each god he had ever heard of.</p>
<p>“This will make a fine space for divine gossip.”</p>
<p>Then Yashqal hollowed out the space under the seating and secured a nice apartment for himself, one with a fine view of the glimmering river.</p>

<p>Crisis in the Holy Land</p>
<p>On the holy island in the Bakwagalis river, the Scorpion Council was losing its sense of purpose during the Shatic dynasty of Wooxti-Kwashotl. The Black Wing Queen had tried to remain neutral in making appointments, never overlooking qualified Stings for the roles of governors, viziers, or generals, however the mere fact of the Prophet-Queen coming from the Society of the Black Wing was causing many humans and yashool to forsake family traditions and show fidelity to the raven.</p>
<p>The Scorpion Council resisted this, they argued that it was impossible to show fidelity to the raven in Wooxti-Kwashotl because there were no ravens native to the jungle. In the year 205, Shata II was succeeded by Tavu, a human male Black Wing, her designated successor. Tavu saw the need to answer the challenges posed by the Scorpion council. He traveled to the Great Forest and negotiated with the chief of the ravens, returning with a flock of 1,000 to settle on the island of the Scorpion Council itself, (being human, Tavu was no stranger acting brashly).</p>
<p>The Council responded with violence, trapping and killing all the ravens they could find. The ravens retaliated, catching and eating all the scorpions they could. It was all devolving rather quickly when Yashqal intervened.</p>
<p>Yashqal created an apparition that could be seen across the island, of a raven and a scorpion wrestling in the air, the raven bit through the exoskeleton as the scorpion dealt a venomous blow to the bird. The message was clear to the priests, by fighting they would extinguish one another. In that year Tavu ordered the Scorpion Council expanded to include 10 Black Wings (5 human, 5 yashool as custom) and renamed the Guidance Council. Peace was restored to the island, and dance continued to be taught there.</p>

<p>Purely Mortal Struggle</p>
<p>The trade route between Raha’stal and Wooxti-Kwashotl ran overland through the jungle and over the mountain range of Primus. This spawned a hospitality industry catering to merchants making the months-long journey on horseback. The Crater of Thool was one such popular stop, so was Chalitsh to the West, a Kwashotl yashool settlement at the confluence of the Bakwagalis and its tributary. They received a Black Wing governor from Shata in the year 5, and their appointments continued to come from the capital.</p>
<p>Ixto (b.191), a female yashool, was born into a noble family in Chalitsh. She prayed to Yashqal and Thool, as was custom. At 14 she was inducted into the Society of the Whisker. Ixto learned to show Fidelity to the titan bearcat in the way that her ancestors had - by stalking the beasts in the jungle with a group of her peers. At night they camped and translated their observations into dances. It was around this time that Tavu ascended to the throne in Wooxti-Kwashotl and brought ravens to the Holy Island of Dance. This distressed her and her elders greatly, to see a king play such favoritism among the dances. Ixto dreamt of one day representing her own Society of the Whisker on the Holy Island. She resolved to prove the worthiness of her society to be included on the Guidance Council, and to that end began to train to be part of the Calitsh governor’s personal guard.</p>
