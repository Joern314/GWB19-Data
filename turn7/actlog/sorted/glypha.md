>###Crisis: Heresy I

>The people of the jumbled mountains had started debating cities, magic and a whole host of other things that made life easier and led to mortals not cherishing life like they should. So in her will to keep them on the right track she made the jumbled Lyva and Glypha had made into her prophet.
>
>The woman with a prehinsile tail made of arms and hands for feet was called Flika. Flika was Glypha's newest prophet. She sent Flika to the people of the jumbled mountains to remind them of the teachings of Glypha.

>###Crisis: Like Vermin I

>The jumbled, beyond the odd cantrip, do not know of magic and therefore are not interested in sacrificing animals in masses.

>###Prompt: The Invisible Silk Roads
>
>The jumbled primarily imported bodies or parts thereof from the surrounding areas. To that purpose they had created little villages towns of jumbled in the surrounding regions. The jumbled offered to take care of the unliving and often helped the injured and maimed regaining the body parts they had lost in accidents or wars so prevalent to the second continent.
>
>The one thing besides bodies they imported were gems. The jumbled on their mountains lived in the natural caves of the mountain. And they tried to improve the caves with their natural skill at crafts Glypha had taught them. And the gems were a decoration the jumbled normally lacked on their mountains.
>
>So in the little village of jumbled near the goblin territories, jumbled mostly made from goblin parts could be found, giving thanks to Gon Gryn for the gifts of the earth. While still sticking to a simple life routine as herders and flesh knitters if the need arose.

>Motley had left the jumbled mountains and seen the civil war in Amalah, the brutality goblins and vampires inflicted on each other, but also the beauty of the ocean and the ingenuity of mortals in the boats that allowed them to cross the sea. 
>
>Wherever she arrived she made her living by helping the people with lost limbs and thereby livelihoods thanks to the gifts of fleshknitting taught to the jumbled by Glypha.
