>Raldric had been training.  
>He was using Blood empowerment more and more than ever, he was a champion of Redgash.  
>He, however, unlike all the other champions, refused the gift of the Red God, vampirism.
>
>He felt he could only be worthy if the Red God spoke to him, or if he performed a mighty deed. a Deed that no one could ever foresee.
>
>The blood empowerment had made him mighty strong.  
>He could punch the mighty beasts of the jungle, killing them in a single blow.
>
>But he felt he needed more. And the call of war had come.
>
>[/u/andrewjamesdrake, Raldric might show up in the war and be a full on badass]

Crisis: Like Vermin  
Silk Road Prompt  
[Here](

>##Crisis: Like Vermin I
>
>The Blood Riders had no such problem, they used very little magic, praticly speaking only Blood Empowerment. And anytime they killed a deer or horse they got magical blood to use.
>
>---
>
>The Vengeful however had such a problem.  
>They had heavy usage of Blood Empowerment they used meant a lot of sacrifices was needed.
>
>They solve this mostly by killing their goblins slaves, that of course, lead to them needing more slaves.
>
>A slave guild started to appear, these warriors specialized in gathering goblin slaves from all sources they can. Traps, assault and the like.
>
>The Vengeful in their city of Redgash was very damaging, a constant stream of slaves are needed for them.
>
>---
>
>##The Invisible Silk Roads
>
>One of the blood riders tribes, half way to the forest where the rangers live.  
>They were one of the few tribes that were somewhat half-friendly with the forest men.
>
>Sometimes, they even traded with them. Sometimes, a trader comes from them, maybe from land far away to buy their horses.
>
>The tribe had developed a habit of fighting other tribes for their horses to trade them.
>
>They had heard ideas coming from the forest people, the idea of 'law'.  
>Most of it was rubbish of course.
>
>But some of them started to adopt a code of honor, the idea of procedure for things.  
>Of course, that was only for them, outsiders had no such protection.

Crisis Heresy  
[Here](

>##Crisis: Heresy I
>
>The Vengeful was getting uneasy. Some were talking if they should try to return to Amalah, or take up new ways again.
>
>Derak, the Vampire Lord of Redgash knew something would be needed. Having his new army tear itself apart would hardly make a good army, they need to survive until they reach Amalah so they can take it after all.
>
>Derak was unease about the Red God, for he had pointed him in the right direction and obviously would not be fond if he failed, he was almost afraid of the Red God.  
>Then, one day, he found a blade. The blade was of exeptional quality, with the name *Ras* engraved on it.  
>
>Derak had a smith look over the blade but the smith could not lift the blade. Only Derak could.
>
>Derak did what he does best and loudly declared the time had come for the sword. He had been given a holy blade, one only he could wield.  
>They would gather arms and take the fight back to Amalah in a Righteous Crusade.
>
>The army gathered, weapons enchanted by followers of the Sorcerers, trained Dinosaurs, some even enchanted as well. Vampires Derak himself had sired to act as his generals, lieutenants and champions.
>
>They set out toward Amalah once more...
>
>[GM: I well the Heresy by focusing them all on a single task, by giving the leader that artifact weapon from the First King
>
>/u/gwydion-drys, battle about to begin.  
>
>/u/andrewjamesdrake   
>How you want this to be done?  
>rolling to see how far the Bloody Crusade gets? Determine something on discord?
>
>My suggestion:  
>I give a rough number of strength I think the Vengeful have.  
>You give a rough number you think the defenders have.  
>We roll a dice and measure up the result
>
>The Vengeful got...
>Vampires +1  
>Blood Enhancement (used by many, not just a small group) +1  
>Dinosaurs +1  
>Surprise attack (+1 for first round only, this is after all, the first major attack on Amalah in any living memory)  
>so +3 (+4 on first roll).
>
>Let's roll d6 3 times.  
>if I win 1 roll, the Crusade gets over the first defensive wall (so first fail, second succeed, means the crusade gets over the wall by the second attempt).  
>More rolls is just how much damage to deals before being driven off.
>
>If we do this, here are my rolls just to speed it along. [I use this dice roller, allows you to tag on modifiers right away](https://www.wizards.com/dnd/dice/dice.htm)
>
>Roll 1: **6** (2+4)  
>Roll 2: **9** (6+3)  
>Roll 3: **8** (5+3)  
>Yes, I rolled really nicely the 2 last rolls :D ]
