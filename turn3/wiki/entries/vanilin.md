### Vanilin[lifeforms]

Created by Lyva, [Turn 3](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/fm061ji/)     
Description: A large scaled warm blooded creature with extremely tough jaws to scrape at metal, and the ability to work said metals into its scales, like a huge pangolin. Hunting such creatures would help those who would dwell here to use the metallic scales for their own ends, or could even potentially farm the creature.
