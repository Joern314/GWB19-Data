### Cosmogony I[lore]

[In the distant future...]

The Shaman moved closer to the fire, beckoning both children and adults to sit down and to listen to the tales and myths of their ancestors. He coughed once, put down his walking stick, and stretched and shook his arms and legs in preparation.

Then the tribesmen grew silent, and the shaman began to dance and speak, enacting the very origin of the world they were all living in...

***

In the beginning, there was the void. And from the void came the first darkness, and with it came Sarah. And as the void vanished, Yashqal began to dance.
But around the void there also was the profane, from which the Witch Oryllia rose, cursing the safe darkness with nightmarish screams.

A third god had been hidden in the void, and to spot him you only need to look into the sky. The countless eyes of Malaphet watch every moment from above, but his words cannot be comprehended, so strange and weird is his mind. The sun is the biggest of his eyes, swollen with an angry red dot where Azrakal once stabbed it. And the stone everyone walks on, it is the bone of a giant skull, which Malaphet had spit out from one of his many mouths.

It is thanks to Lyva that the mortals need not live on its inside, for she filled it with her most precious possessions, sacrificing more wealth than any mortal could ever dream to have.

After the ground was formed, Kain released the air, and the Salty Knave rode the ocean that appeared in a giant flood.

Rictus then brought the first land, and he began to form the first humans, more noble than any other creature. But their bodies were without blood, and only when Azrakal gave them his own, did they awake and walk around.

Yet, immediately afterwards, he demanded they return the gift, he tried to take back the very essence the humans need to live! If not for the protector, Sarah, this would have been the end of them.

Azrakal is an evil god, and up to that moment he already had offended many of the other divine as well. Some say he even brought the Unliving as a twisted curse, others say that the Undying were beyond his powers.

Either way, that moment his offenses could no longer be tolerated. The Sorcerer brought back to life those whom Azrakal had slain, and taught them how to get to the Rift after their death. The other gods subdued Azrakal and tore off his skin, putting it on the world as an additional layer of dirt and stone.

This was not the only time the gods were fighting, there were plenty times when the world was at danger due to their violence. Malaphet once almost squeezed it into two halves, leaving a gaping trench behind. And the rumbling mountains spew fire even in this day, created by Sunda who fought with his mother Lyva.

There also were peaceful scenes of cooperation, like when Thool crafted the moon from a tooth of Malaphet, or when Gon Gryn, Prismari and Sunda gathered stones for the second continent, or when Shilo won against the other spirits of grain, or when Prismari began the legends of heroes. There even was a comet, who brought the Essence of Life and gave our world a spin, such that the sun would reach all the lands equally.

Countless more stories are there, of the children of the gods, and their grandchildren, the smaller gods like the Recorder, and the bigger ones like the Gargantuan Snake.

But those are for another time...

The shaman's speech and dance ended.

Casually he tried to play over his exhaustion, leaning against the cave walls.

After a moment of silence, somebody asked: "What happened to the gods? Why aren't they around us right now?" The shaman coughed once and said: "They... have to rest, needed a break from creation." He smiled. "Just like I need a break right now. Is the cooking finally done?"
