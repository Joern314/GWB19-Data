###The Forgotten[gods]

**Player**: /u/Abacadaren

**Spheres**: Lost things and Sentiments

**Appearance**: The Forgotten appear as a pile of discarded scrap and items, like a junkyard given life. Broken dolls, Old tools, Books with torn pages, all set in motion of one united goal: to have back what once meant so much to them.

As far as sound, The Forgotten are in a way able to speak, either through old and worn voice boxes and speakers, or the imitation of speech through the crunching and creaking of it's piles.

**Plans and Style**: The Forgotten intend to be remembered and to reduce the number of things that are lost. Their ultimate goal is, in a way, their own destruction and the removal of their furthered creation

**Origin**: Since the beginning of creation, creations have been set to the ways side. Things that once meant so much to someone can come to mean nothing in time. It's hard to remember exactly when you forgot, just that you forgot it. When The Forgotten tried to not be is anyone's guess.

**Further explanation**:

Lost things here in refers to second death style things, lost to the point no one else would be able to find/connect. This includes lost memories as well, to tie into Sentiment. The dead are a difficult case, so to set it as clear and best as possible I deal in lost things, not lost people. Spirits and souls can remember things and pass on their memories, but they do not count as remembering things themselves.

Sentiment refers to connection and emotion, like love or care (though it can be negative sentiments). The feelings one has towards a favorite stuffed animal, or the love for a family member.
