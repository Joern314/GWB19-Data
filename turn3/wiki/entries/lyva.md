###Lyva[gods]

**Player:** /u/Smcadam       

**Spheres:** Greed and Metal     
             
**Appearance**: Lyva’s usual form is an athletic metallic goddess with curling horns amidst her long hair, and a long tail. Various panels and scales on her can open like drawers and doors to a pocket dimension where she hoards and collects… well, anything that catches her attention.                        
She normally flaunts her wealth by wearing a vast diversity of jewellery and dresses. She can shapeshift, normally changing what metal she seems composed of, or turning into a metallic asian style dragon occasionally.      

**Origin**: Lyva was originally “born” in a divine accident, from another deities greed breaking off. She’s tempered a little bit by wisdom and cunning since her birth, but fundamentally just wants everything. She quickly acquired adoptive parents, friends and lovers, and used them to ascend to full godhood, before leaving to claim her own planet.
