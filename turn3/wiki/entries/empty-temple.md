After the disappearance of the gods, the fall of the old empires and the end of the era of legend and myth some mortals were glad to be rid of the disturbance the gods represented to the world. Some people however missed the gods and the more colorful advanced world they represented. 

Among them were a group of Apokryph and humans in the Hunting Grounds, who wanted to convince their gods to return. And that marked the begin of the construction of the Empty Temple.

Meant to be a temple to the gods like many stories of old talk about, the Empty Temple started out as a hut. A luxurious hut, but a hut nontheless. For the mortals it would have been a splendid home, but to the gods it was not. 

Crude boulders, rocks, planks of wood, hides of animals, gems and whatever else the mortals could conceive of as building materials were used to enlargen, enrich and spruce up the empty temple. It was all in all a try to bribe the gods into returning. 

And even when the gods finally did return after millenia they still did not pay attention to the Empty Temple. For all it was it was still just a hut after all. And so the Apokryph and humans keep building and changing the Empty Temple, year after year, day after day, doomed to never be finished.

The Empty Temple is situated on a hill near Sanctuary. Its internal structures are comprised of megaliths, which serve as the bones of the structure. The backroom serves as a small workshop where primitive statues of the gods are hewn from flint and limestone.

At the entrance figures maybe depicting the Sorcerer and Rictus can be found, but due to the age of the statues and the crudeity of the fabrication it is hard to tell.

Inside the main room two pits serve as sacrifice pits to burn offerings to the god in.

As it is meant to serve as a home to the gods many furs, seats and primitive tables can be found within the side rooms as well as sleeping and fire places. There are no walls per se, but with wooden struts and sticks connected to the megaliths a framework for walls is formed. The "walls" themselves consist of furs, dried foliage and wicker.

The "walls" are painted in primitive colors, mostly depicting mythological scenarios, like the creation of humans and Apokryph, the laying of Azrakal, Rak being dragged to death by the Sorcerer or the first Iron Judge sentencing Ras, the blood emperor.
