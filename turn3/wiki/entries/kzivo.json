The whole thing gives him a melted look. He carries around a large and strange pickaxe.\n\nHis exact origins are unknown; Gon Gryn awoke one day to find him simply working on expanding the caves in the shattered mountains. It is his job. Apparently he is the brother of Olasea, Minor Goddess of Erosion.",
