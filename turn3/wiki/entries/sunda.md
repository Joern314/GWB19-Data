### Sunda[gods]

/u/StarOfTheSouth

**Appearance:** Sunda is a chimera. The back half of a goat, the front half and head of a lion. His tail is a serpent, on his back he bares the wings of a bat (appropriately sized), and small horns curl back over his head.

**Spheres:** Animals and Wilds

**Plans and Style:** I mostly plan on mutating and combining animals, taking what we already have and twisting it into something new.

**Origin:** One of Lyva's scales broke loose, combined with the last remnants of that Act Feyrun threw through the sun, and turned into Sunda.

**Further Explanation:** Not really sure what needs to be elaborated on, as I'm mostly just planning on doing character stuff this game. No big plans from me.
