The castes are determined by the runic markings on their bodies they are born with. These marks are interpreted by the Sorcerer's priests or other representatives how to at birth.\n\nThe three castes and their societal roles are as follows:\n\n**Philosophers** are the administrative caste. Their caste provide civic leaders, priests and scholars. They are born with magically enhanced intellect.\n\n**Guardians** are the martial caste of the Apokryph-society. They serve as warriors, police as well as intelligence gatherers and in times of need assassins. They are born with magically enhanced speed, strength, dexterity and agility.\n\n**Citizens** are the working caste of the Apokryph. Artists, artisans, farmers, hunters and every other profession requiring workers is part of this caste. They are born with magically enhanced endurance, patience and health.\n\n**Mages** are born with an intuitive grasp of magic and extreme magical talent. They play a separated role in society. They are not bound by the restrictions of the castes. Their role is to teach the different castes how to harness their innate magical powers and to use their magic effectively and to keep the magical knowledge of the Apokryphs. They also are tasked with guarding Apokryph-society against magical and supernatural threats.\nInnate magical are awakened in a religious ceremony wherein a small animal is sacrificed by the child to awaken their power to the Sorcerer or whichever god the Apokryph follow.",
