( /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW ) \n\n**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flg98lz/)\n\n**Description**: \nA feather shaped blade that has turned to pitch black obsidian after being used in a ritual to ascend to godhood. A fuller ran the length of the blade and formed what would have been the stem of the feather. The shining brass or gold guard was formed in the shape of wings, the handle wrapped in a what had become rough blackened leather in a criss-cross fasion, and the pommel was in the shape of a bird's head with three eyes. Each eye was a different gemstone; emerald, ruby, and diamond.\n\nThe Retaliator was sword of divine creation that Gon brought along with him from another world. Having lost its old patron and having being used as a catalyst to create Gon's spark of divinity, it was been rendered powerless and immaterial.\n\n**Blessings**: 0 (The blade exists as a part of Gon's divine form only, for now.)",
