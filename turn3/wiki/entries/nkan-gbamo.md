Temple-caves with large square passages, rooms, and stairs underneath The Shattered Mountains. The walls and ceiling are littered with the jewels from when Gon formed the mountain range and glitter with any source of light. At the deepest point, the largest chamber serves as an audience hall with a single stone throne where Gon met with all the various minor gods he had pulled into his service. A smaller room off of this chamber served as his inner sanctum and living quarters.
