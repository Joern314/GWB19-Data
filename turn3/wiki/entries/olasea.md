**Description**: 
Olasea appears as a very energetic young girl made of perfectly smooth granite wearing what looks like rages but are actually extremely smooth pieces of slate.

She can most often be found on mountain tops, sanding away rough edges, breaking apart stones with a hammer, and causing rock slides. After trying to break Gon Gryn in their first encounter she began considering him the "big boss" who provides her with all of her work. Apparently she is the sister of Kzivo, Minor God of Caves.
