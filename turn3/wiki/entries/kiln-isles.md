A volcanic archipelago of Islands off the northern coast of Primus, created by Lyva triggering a massive eruption after a sleep. It has a vibrant and quite peaceful ecosystem with few predators built on the volcanic ash of the islands eruption. Trees growing here were tough and hardy, grass was thick, and she added peaceful creatures like kiwis, oxen, horses, goats, apes and many species of birds and snakes across the hills. In the shallow waters, large amphibious geckos as big as horses roamed, and many bright tropical insects.
