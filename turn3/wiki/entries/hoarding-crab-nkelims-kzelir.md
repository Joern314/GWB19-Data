These strange hermit like crabs had exoskeletons of gray and brown that match the colors of the caves, but the back half of their body glows intensely and the gather up jewels and slowly craft them into shell like houses with mud and muck that when they occupy them causes them to glow through all the embedded colors like some crazy light show. These little creatures will take jewels from anywhere they can get them, including jewelry. If one manages to find one of their little nest holes, there is almost always a deposit of all kinds of jewels there.
