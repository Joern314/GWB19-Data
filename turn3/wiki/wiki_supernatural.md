## Metaphysics

###The Thirteen Hexes

**Creator**: Oryllia(/u/DragoneyeCreations)

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flhf0w8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**Description**: A set of thirteen distinct blights upon the world, forged by the primordial dregs of creation.

####Hex 1 - The Soil Shrieks

Every time a region of the world is covered in darkness, the air is filled with bloodcurdling screams.

###Fidelity

**Creator**: Yashqal(/u/hpllamacrft)

**Created**: [Turn 1]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flhz5pr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**Description**: The true essence of all things, which can be mimicked to induce transformation. 

Every thing has a core essence. This essence can be perceived by the outward characteristics of a thing. Creatures can change their own core essence by dancing in a way that mimics the core essence of another thing. This is called showing fidelity. By showing fidelity to a thing one adopts a thingâ€™s outward characteristics to a limited degree.
For example, a mortal looking to become tougher may show fidelity to a boulder. From observing the boulder they invent a boulder dance that captures the essence of boulders. Then the mortal practices this boulder dance for years; his skin grows tough and he is able to withstand strikes with greater resistance. In the same way, a fox dance may make someone stealthier, the gazelle dance may make someone more beautiful, the fruit dance may make someone more fertile.

###Tsukumogami, or Familial Bonding

**Creator**: /u/Abacadaren

**Created**: [Turn 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flte821/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=GodhoodWB&utm_content=t1_flsx2v4)

**Description**: Items gain power based off the time that it spends with its owner who gives special care and attention to it (Whether positive or negative). Items can be passed on to family members which regress the years to halfway through the previous phase (Excluding the final phase). For all intents and purposes aside from worship, items that have bonded to the 100+ years phase are mortals.

Years Owned | Power
:--|:--:
1-32| Easier/Harder maintenance, can make small jumps/jerks of motion, Aware of who owns it
33-66| Finer control of self, can provide the feeling of an emotion to its owner, able to "see" up to 5 ft away (Blindsight 5 ft), and weak special abilities based off of what the item is (Mirror can control its reflection, cooking knife can auto-chop ingredients as long as its held, stuffed animals can make animal noises)
67-99| Can do multiple actions in a row, Can provide concepts/ideas to owner, Blindsight 10 ft, special abilities are strengthened
100+| Full control of self like any person would have control over their body, Sentient personality based off of experience and owner(s), able to communicate with those around it, Blindsight 20 ft, Can be passed on to family or friends without any regression of power. Item never losses its sentience or ability unless destroyed

Of note, hero artifacts are spawned from a soul and as such aren't fully inanimate objects to be affected by this metaphysics, but things like artifacts can be

###The Blood Dagger

**Creator**: Azrakal (/u/Plintstorm ) 

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgrobm/)

**Description**: A dagger forged with the scales of Lyva and the Blood of Azrakal. The Dagger absorbs blood, including that inside the people it stab.

###The Retaliator

**Creator**: ??? ( /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW ) 

**Created**: [Turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flg98lz/)

**Description**: 
A feather shaped blade that has turned to pitch black obsidian after being used in a ritual to ascend to godhood. A fuller ran the length of the blade and formed what would have been the stem of the feather. The shining brass or gold guard was formed in the shape of wings, the handle wrapped in a what had become rough blackened leather in a criss-cross fasion, and the pommel was in the shape of a bird's head with three eyes. Each eye was a different gemstone; emerald, ruby, and diamond.

The Retaliator was sword of divine creation that Gon brought along with him from another world. Having lost its old patron and having being used as a catalyst to create Gon's spark of divinity, it was been rendered powerless and immaterial.

**Blessings**: 0 (The blade exists as a part of Gon's divine form only, for now.)
