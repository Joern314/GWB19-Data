###Gon Gryn, Vengeance Reborn

**Player**: /u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW

**Spheres**: Earth and Vengeance

**Appearance**:
A tall and muscular half-bird, half-elven man - a race known as the Gryn - with earthy brown skin covered in bright white scars. The most noticeable of these is the scar over his left eye. In place of hair, he has a crest of feathers similar in appearance to a filled-in native american chief’s headdress. These feathers fade from a bright green to a vibrant purple, with three longer feathers fading from purple to green. Green eyes flecked with purple seem to be full of intensity and he usually wears an odd smirk. Below the knees his legs become those of an eagle and end in sharp black talons. Gon doesn’t seem particularly picky about what he wears, and can often be found wearing whatever clothes are provided to him by Lyva. He does slightly favor dressing in white, but for formal occasions he dresses in a green feather robe; a memento of his “father”. In battle, he wears traditional Arakyl feathermail over a purple padded tunic. The only thing he consistently has on his person is a particular sword known as The Retaliator with its plain dark leather sheath and belt.

**Plans and Style**:
Gon has only recently ascended into godhood and the shift from a demi-god to a full fledged divine being has left a mark on him. He intends to make the best of his new powers and rather simply enjoy himself. The fetters of fate, however, may not be so easy to sever.

Being the amnesiatic form of a god from another existence, Gon has a strange mix of apathy and curiosity about him. He has a knack for understanding magic and seeks it out with enthusiasm, but tends to laze around otherwise. Outwardly friendly, Gon only truly enjoys the company of those who have become consumed by some desire; he enjoys seeing them work tirelessly towards their goals. Especially if those goals include revenge.

**Origin**:
Gon was a semi-divine being created partially from the soul fragment of a god with the same name from the Fire Realm and the memories and personality of the phoenix god, Nekalos Toneyl. His former self was apparently destroyed along with Nek’s home realm, but the god attempted to achieve resurrection in a new plane of existence by placing a fragment of his soul in the banished phoenix god. Interference from the Serpent Goddess Celastra of Space, Secrets, and Shadows caused the plan to fail and Gon’s memories were stolen and placed into a demigoddess known as Lyva. Following the recreation of his body as a demigod, the amnesiatic Gon - known as Hunger - found himself somewhat enamored with the demigoddess and her greed. Seeking refuge from a dysfunctional family relationship with Nek and his demigoddess daughter, Hylatka, Hunger decided he would stay with Lyva. Once Lyva had achieved true divinity, Hunger agreed to travel away from the world with her to seek his own divinity elsewhere.

Divinity itself, however, has a price; as he traveled with Lyva, Gon was able to modify the so-called “Toneyl Divinity Manipulation Magic” developed by Hylatka and create a divine spark by siphoning the power of souls consumed by his blade into himself. Unfortunately, this seems to have had some side effects…

###Lyva     

**Player:** /u/Smcadam       

**Spheres:** Greed and Metal     
             
**Appearance**: Lyva’s usual form is an athletic metallic goddess with curling horns amidst her long hair, and a long tail. Various panels and scales on her can open like drawers and doors to a pocket dimension where she hoards and collects… well, anything that catches her attention.                        
She normally flaunts her wealth by wearing a vast diversity of jewellery and dresses. She can shapeshift, normally changing what metal she seems composed of, or turning into a metallic asian style dragon occasionally.      

**Origin**: Lyva was originally “born” in a divine accident, from another deities greed breaking off. She’s tempered a little bit by wisdom and cunning since her birth, but fundamentally just wants everything. She quickly acquired adoptive parents, friends and lovers, and used them to ascend to full godhood, before leaving to claim her own planet.

###Oryllia, the Witch-Queen

**Player**: /u/DragoneyeCreations

**Spheres**: Hexes and Contracts

**Appearance**: Oryllia appears as a feminine figure made of violet fire, with metallic pieces adorning her like armor. Most notably, a plate with long curling horns covers her eyes like a blindfold. She wields a hammer, covered in runes.

**Plans and Style**: Oryllia, being a goddess of hexes and contracts, seeks to curse both the land and individuals through various means. She lures mortals in via contracts with her, which will nearly always end in the mortal being cursed. Primarily, she will be feared, and those who actively worship her will be those pushed to the fringes of society for being profane.

**Origins**: Oryllia was born out of the dregs of creation, the profanity, the sludge that soon became the pit from which all of her Hexes came from.

**Further Explanation**: Oryllia is an evil aligned god, so expect plenty of chaos to come from her. It’ll be a mix of simple tricks and horrendous evil.

###The Forgotten

**Player**: /u/Abacadaren

**Spheres**: Lost things and Sentiments

**Appearance**: The Forgotten appear as a pile of discarded scrap and items, like a junkyard given life. Broken dolls, Old tools, Books with torn pages, all set in motion of one united goal: to have back what once meant so much to them.

As far as sound, The Forgotten are in a way able to speak, either through old and worn voice boxes and speakers, or the imitation of speech through the crunching and creaking of it's piles.

**Plans and Style**: The Forgotten intend to be remembered and to reduce the number of things that are lost. Their ultimate goal is, in a way, their own destruction and the removal of their furthered creation

**Origin**: Since the beginning of creation, creations have been set to the ways side. Things that once meant so much to someone can come to mean nothing in time. It's hard to remember exactly when you forgot, just that you forgot it. When The Forgotten tried to not be is anyone's guess.

**Further explanation**:

Lost things here in refers to second death style things, lost to the point no one else would be able to find/connect. This includes lost memories as well, to tie into Sentiment. The dead are a difficult case, so to set it as clear and best as possible I deal in lost things, not lost people. Spirits and souls can remember things and pass on their memories, but they do not count as remembering things themselves.

Sentiment refers to connection and emotion, like love or care (though it can be negative sentiments). The feelings one has towards a favorite stuffed animal, or the love for a family member.

###The Sorcerer

/u/Gwydion-Drys

**Spheres:** Magic and Death

**Appearance:** The Sorcerer is humanoid in appearance. What distinguishes him from a normal human however is his grey skin, which is covered in tattoos and runic markings, retelling his life story to those who can interpret them.

He is normally clothed in splendorous traveling clothes and wears a hooded cloak. His eyes are representative of a dark night sky filled with stars.

**Plans and Style:** Magic, Death and the Afterlife are linked. Expect to see as much in-game.

**Origin:** The Sorcerer was once the prophet of a god of magic and darkness before he rose to the rank of a demigod and finally ascended to full godhood. In the absence of his once patron deity, he himself took over the leadership of his people. And now he wanders the multiverse in search of a new world that could make an apt permanent home for his people, after their erstwhile world suffered catastrophe after catastrophe.

**Further Explanation:** The Sorcerer was once an idealistic youth trying to follow in his patron's footsteps to be a force of good. Repeated betrayals by his closest allies have made him pragmatic and weary and have shifted his focus from looking out for everyone to looking out for his people.

###Sunda

/u/StarOfTheSouth

**Appearance:** Sunda is a chimera. The back half of a goat, the front half and head of a lion. His tail is a serpent, on his back he bares the wings of a bat (appropriately sized), and small horns curl back over his head.

**Spheres:** Animals and Wilds

**Plans and Style:** I mostly plan on mutating and combining animals, taking what we already have and twisting it into something new.

**Origin:** One of Lyva's scales broke loose, combined with the last remnants of that Act Feyrun threw through the sun, and turned into Sunda.

**Further Explanation:** Not really sure what needs to be elaborated on, as I'm mostly just planning on doing character stuff this game. No big plans from me.
