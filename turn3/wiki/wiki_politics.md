In mainstream Apokryph-society people are born into one of three castes. The castes are determined by the runic markings on their bodies they are born with. These marks are interpreted by the Sorcerer's priests or other representatives how to at birth.

The three castes and their societal roles are as follows:

**Philosophers** are the administrative caste. Their caste provide civic leaders, priests and scholars. They are born with magically enhanced intellect.

**Guardians** are the martial caste of the Apokryph-society. They serve as warriors, police as well as intelligence gatherers and in times of need assassins. They are born with magically enhanced speed, strength, dexterity and agility.

**Citizens** are the working caste of the Apokryph. Artists, artisans, farmers, hunters and every other profession requiring workers is part of this caste. They are born with magically enhanced endurance, patience and health.

**Mages** are born with an intuitive grasp of magic and extreme magical talent. They play a separated role in society. They are not bound by the restrictions of the castes. Their role is to teach the different castes how to harness their innate magical powers and to use their magic effectively and to keep the magical knowledge of the Apokryphs. They also are tasked with guarding Apokryph-society against magical and supernatural threats.
Innate magical are awakened in a religious ceremony wherein a small animal is sacrificed by the child to awaken their power to the Sorcerer or whichever god the Apokryph follow.

#### The Rift Keepers

These are the old Apokryphes choosing to mostly stay in the Rift. They have seen other realities and are weary of the world. But they do run through reincarnation all the same, their souls just never leave the Rift anymore, unless they are sent to collect the souls of dead people from the prime material plane.

If they do this duty they are hooded and cloaked, faced hidden behind masks. They carry lanterns of Rift Tree fruit to guide along the dead. 

Rift Keeper society largely follows the conventions laid out by the Sorcerer for the future (See nations – Magocracy).

### Blood Riders

**Creator**: The Sorcerer, Lyva

**Amended**: -

**Description**: Apokryph look a lot like slightly taller than average humans. They have gray skin and night-blue eyes. Their hair colors range from white and gray over brown to black. The Apokryph are born with dark runic markings on their bodies. These markings change with the stories of their lives. 

The Sorcerer and his clergy can read these markings to determine the caste an Apokryph belongs to. As these markings change the stations and powers of an Apokryph, his or her station change in life and Apokryph-society. They also have horns to commemorate the hand of Lyva in their creation.

In their veins flows a great amount of magic extending their natural life spans up to 300 years. Additionally, they have innate magical powers making them more adept at the jobs their caste is tasked with, as Apokryph society is intended by their original creator to be a caste structure. Currently, the Apokryph can however not access their life spans and innate magic as they are not yet accustomed to life in this new world.

**Description**: “All his life he tried to be a good person. Many times, however, he failed.
For, after all, he was only human. He wasn't a dog.” - *Charles M. Schulz*

### Nkarlen, the Cave Goblins

/u/WHOSGOTYOURSKINNOW [Turn 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/flu8tjs/)

The Nkarlen are a race of four to five feet tall agile pointy-eared humanoids with crooked noses and angry looking eyes. They are extreme omnivores and will attempt to eat anything and everything. They have incredibly strong teeth and stomach acid and can therefore eat even small rocks. Created by a god of vengeance, they have a tendency to never forget even the smallest slight. When this is combined with their natural lack of sympathy, they can become hell-bent on payback. They are short-lived - their average max life span is only 40 years - but they breed like rabbits; it is common for one pair of goblins to have ten to twelve children.

They have a naturally agile and skinny physique allowing them to slip through their caves and holes quickly. Their skin is usually a mottled gray/brown, but extended exposure to light turns them green. Those goblins who never leave their caves often develop darker brown skin to the point where it is almost black. Their voices usually range from shrill to guttural with nothing in between. Goblins with normal voices are rare.

### Yashool

"If it is blood they want, it is blood they shall have". Thool appeared to the leader of the newly created living trees on the edge of the forests. "My name is Thool. With the helo of the god Yaqshal, we have given you life. What will you call yourselves?"

"We are the creation of Yashqal and Thool, so we are the Yashool. We will protect the woodlands for the rest of our days and honor the gift of fidelity" the biggest of the trees responded.

## Nations

### The Magocracy

The Magocracy may in future live up to its potential and become the grand nation of magic. But for now they are not more than a primitive tribe with a primitive village led by a shaman. And the caste system only crudely observed.

Though following the Sorcerer's plans the Apokryphes will in time transform their society into the Magocracy, building a nation on the material plane akin to the society of Apokryphs as established in the Rift.

With their caste society having religious and cultural meaning. No caste is higher than another in social standing. They just serve as crude way to determine one's vocation in life. Administration, sciences and works of pure intellect are done by the Philosophers. The Guardians are the defenders of the nation and work in every way the defense of the nation requires from military service and training to espionage and other less unsavory practices of war and politics. The citizens do the day to day work. Although money plays never a large role in the nation. Money is mostly frowned upon and only used to trade with foreigners.. The mages are a casteless part of society involved in all workings their help and presence is needed.

People carry a private name for personal use and a public use-name. People who distinguish themslves are given titles by the leaders of society like The Guardian or The Warrior.

As in the Rift the nation is supposed to be governed by the Inner Council. Where all Apokryphes castes and all cities contribute a councilor. The Circle is lead by the First Councilor whose job it is to break ties in votes. The Circle is advised by the mages

While all forms of art are a trade for the Citizen case the pursuit of art and knowledge in their freetime is encouraged. The masks nearly all citizens wear not only carry marks of their station in society, but can also be customized to a degree and are the prime opportunity for Apokryphs to show their artistic skills.

The nations of the Apokryphs have in many worlds left their mark by being the biggest exporters of enchanted wares and no one says they can not do it again.

#### Epoidos and The White Gates

On the Kiln islands there is a patch of Rift Wood. It's Rift Trees have been carved into the shape of a gateway. On the hinges of this gateway are two heavy white gates. These gates are the only entrance from the prime material plane to the Sleeping City in the Rift.

So it should not come as a surprise that around these gates a settlement of Apokryphs have collected. Worshipping the Sorcerer they founded the city of Epoidos here to guard these gates to the afterlife.

While there is not yet much magic to study the Sorcerer intended for this town to become the worlds premiere center of magical learning. The town where the knowledge of everything magical in this world is kept. A veritable holy land of the Sorcerer, where those wanting to learn his teaching can flock together.

### Sanctuary

The Hunting Grounds were the ancestral home of humanity. Made by Rictus and traveled by his people under the guidance of the Iron Judges it was home to many nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes of humans, using the magical arrows Rictus had given their forefathers to hunt.

Their is however one town where the Iron Judges meet to deliberate on recent events, religious matters and tribal business. The place is called Sanctuary. Where outside the tribes often squabble over the best places to hunt, sources of water or the best trees to make arrows from in Sanctuary the Iron Law reigns supreme and no one dares to break the law given to humanity by their creator and patron Rictus.

It is no one wonder then that the center of worship for Rictus is also Sanctuary. The people of Sanctuary try to live by the Iron Law and try to educate visitors on the Iron Law in accordance with the teachings of Rictus. The town of Sanctury is the holy land of Rictus.

## Organizations

### Society of the Sting, Society of the Whisker, Society of the Black Wing

The oldest of these was the Society of the Sting, those human and yashool who showed Fidelity to the scorpion. These were the men responsible for eating the Unliving, an unpleasant, but honored task to control their unbearable competition. In the forest, great respect was shown to the ravens for their supernatural intelligence. The most elite human and yashool were initiated into the Society of the Black Wing. They would make elaborate feathered costumes and beaked masks to dance Fidelity to the raven. In the jungle, the Bearcat was king because of its supernatural strength. The elite, human and yashool, in their respective tribes, joined the Society of the Whisker, fashioning costumes and dancing Fidelity to gain an increment of this physical power.
