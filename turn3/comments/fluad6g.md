###The Sorcerer [Gods]

Info: /u/Gwydion-Drys [Turn 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fo2h2r/game_19_endless_pantheon_applications/flcurqi/)

**Spheres:** Magic and Death

**Appearance:** The Sorcerer is humanoid in appearance. What distinguishes him from a normal human however is his grey skin, which is covered in tattoos and runic markings, retelling his life story to those who can interpret them.

He is normally clothed in splendours travelling clothes and wears a hooded cloak. His eyes are representative of a dark night sky filled with stars.

**Plans and Style:** Magic, Death and the Afterlife are linked. Expect to see as much in-game.

**Origin:** The Sorcerer was once the prophet of a god of magic and darkness before he rose to the rank of a demigod and finally ascended to full godhood. In the absence of his once patron deity, he himself took over the leadership of his people. And now he wanders the multiverse in search of a new world that could make an apt permanent home for his people, after their erstwhile world suffered catastrophe after catastrophe.

**Further Explanation:** The Sorcerer was once an idealistic youth trying to follow in his patron's footsteps to be a force of good. Repeated betrayals by his closest allies have made him pragmatic and weary and have shifted his focus from looking out for everyone to looking out for his people.

###Life after Death [Metaphysics]

Info: /u/Gwydion-Drys [Turn 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgku2r/)

**Creator**: The Sorcerer

**Amended**: -

**Description**: In accordance with the laws of thermodynamics energy can not be created or destroyed only displaced and transformed. The energy of life permeating mortal bodies does not fade with death.

In animals the energy once keeping them alive turns into magical energy. The one and only source for everything magical. This magical energy has only a very short halflife and dissipates into the surrounding world as light and heat energy.

Once a mortal has reached the end of his/her/its natural life span or is killed in another way the soul is separated from the body. The body however does not die off. It is transformed into a so called “Unliving”.

The Unliving are feral beings not unlike zombies, but instead of rotting they are functionally alive bodies without minds beyond those of primitive animals only set on sating their base desires like food, drink and procreation.

If an Unliving is killed its animating force turns into magical energy as well. The transformation from magical energy to heat and light occurs in seconds. An Unliving explodes with the force of a grenade and the smaller the animal the less force/ magic is released.

To kill an Unliving its brain needs to be destroyed. Any parts attached to the head stay active.

Unclaimed souls and those claimed by the Sorcerer are after death escorted to the afterlife in the “Rift”, the Sorcerer's plane, by the mortals inhabiting the Rift and only those inhabiting the Rift.

The Unliving yearn to sate all their animal desires including food, sleep and sex at all costs. They are however biologically mortal and produce mortal children.

#### The Rift [Planes]

Info: /u/Gwydion-Drys [Turn 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/foo57w/endless_pantheon_turn_1/flgku2r/)

**Creator**: The Sorcerer

**Amended**: -

**Description**: The Sorcerer's very own plane between worlds. For the souls of the dead it functions as an afterlife for the Apokryph it is their home dimension. 

The Rift is a volatile, shifting and twisted mirror version of the material world. It grows and changes as the material plane does. The Rift is a place born of Magic and Death. The **Endless Woods** make up the majority of the plane. It is steeped in eternal darkness. The terrain is unreliable and distances change at will. Where an hour ago a river was flowing now a mountain could be standing.

At the center of the plane, suspended in mid air instead of a sun hovers a white city, **Oneiros**, the city of sleep.

Three kinds of dead souls are found in the Rift:

- The first are souls with no other afterlife to go to.

- The second are the faithful of the Sorcerer.

- The third are the souls of the dead Apokryph, waiting for reincarnation.

The first two kinds are judged and either allowed entrance to Oneiros, where they can sleep and dream away the time. 

If they are found unworthy they are tossed into the Endless Woods where they are forced to prey on each for eternity, while their worst nightmares take shape and torment all of them equally.

The third kind live among their living kin, but are unable to leave the Rift.

Beyond that the Rift connects to all Rift Woods of the material world. Mortals, who know how and dare to enter, will be able to go to this plane through the Rift Woods. Then they can wander the Rift until they reach a place connecting to a different patch of Rift Wood and return through there to the material plane or they find the hidden way to Oneiros, where they can try to reach their dead loved ones.

While people not privy to the secrets of mastering the Rift Woods and the Rift will be in danger of stumbling blind into this plane and never come back. Because they run afoul of the dangers of the Endless Woods, wandering through the Rift until they die. Or they stumble back into the mortal world in a random patch of Rift Wood, possibly on the opposite side of the world, driven mad by the horrors of the Endless Woods. Creatures and plants can make their way around the world in this way as well and wander into the Rift, where they become inhabitants of the Rift itself. 

Upon significant events in the material world, like the founding of an important city, a battle or the creation of an especially holy sight etc., a similar location will come into existence in a corresponding place in the Rift. Negative events like battles or especially grisly murders spawn a place haunted by the deepest and darkest horrors of the Rift. While positive events like an especially heroic act or similar things will create one of the rare sanctuaries of the Rift. Here mortals and other beings wandering the Rift can find a safe haven for a short while. As with all places in the Rift, these suffer from volatile topography and shifting surroundings as well. Unless guided by someone in the know it is highly unlikely for people to come out of the Rift in one piece.

####Locations in the Rift:

**Oneiros, the City of Sleep**: At the center of the plane, suspended in mid air, hovers a white city, Oneiros, the city of sleep. Here those who have earned a reward, dream away the time. It is also the primary home of the Apokryph in the Rift.

**Endless Woods**: A woodland haunted by those deemed unworthy to enter Oneiros. It is overrun by the nightmares of the Damned, who are forced to prey on each other for eternity. The topography and geography is permanently shifting and the Woods are shrouded in near complete darkness.

**Rift Woods**: Patches of crystalline tree like structures that grow in wooded areas on land or coral reefs under water. They can be found in the material plane and the Rift. These patches of crystalline woods mark the entrances/exits of the Rift.

### The Apokryph

Info: /u/Gwydion-Drys [Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/flnbxy2/)


**Creator**: The Sorcerer, Lyva

**Amended**: -

**Description**: Apokryph look a lot like slightly taller than average humans. They have gray skin and night-blue eyes. Their hair colors range from white and gray over brown to black. The Apokryph are born with dark runic markings on their bodies. These markings change with the stories of their life's. 

The Sorcerer and his clergy can read these markings to determine the caste an Apokryph belongs to. As these markings change the stations and powers of an Apokryph, his or her station change in life and Apokryph-society. They also have horns to comemorate the hand of Lyva in their creation.

In their veins flows a great amount of magic extending their natural life spans up to 300 years. Additionally they have innate magical powers making them more adapt at the jobs their caste is tasked with, as Apokryph society is intended by their original creator to be a caste structure. Currently the Apokryph can however not access their life spans and innate magic as they are not yet accustomed to life in this new world.

### Panoptes [Minor Gods]

Info: /u/Gwydion-Drys  [Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/fln8py8/)

The Sorcerer remade the divine soul of the Recorder, a minor god he had killed as it was sent by Azrakal to spy on the Sorcerer, into Panoptes. He sits on the highest tower of Oneiros in the Rift and directs the Rift Keepers to their duty to collect souls.

Panoptes is a tall figure. Almost human. It just has hundreds of eyes all over its head. The  Panoptes means the all-eyed or allseer. 

Panoptes would look out into the Rift and the world and keep track of mortal lives and lifespans. He would record the deeds of the living and steer them towards an afterlife in the Endless Woods or Oneiros depending on their deeds. And he would dispatch the Rift Keepers living in Oneiros to collect the souls of the living back to the Rift.
