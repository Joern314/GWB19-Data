"I am glad you like it, here." Gon said as he shifted under her, put an arm around her with a grin, and moved his head to one side if she still wanted to see. " This is Nkom, Minor God of Gems. He's a lazy one. Let's see if I can get him up."

"Nkom! Aalaulo roenenk ludo! Ub!" Gon yelled at the minor god and chucked a rock at it.

The great cat stirred with a growl, flicked its tail, and turned its head on its paws to look at the pair before yawning.

"Da Ig gbivo ga?" The sleepy creature replied in a velvet tone.

"Aalos!"

"Srrreno..." The big gemstone cat growled as it stretched and stood up to approach the throne, coming close enough as if it wanted to be petted.

"G'bolla, maal Lidaal, maal Lald." The cat started, Gon shook his head, and the cat continued in an unperturbed velvety tone. "Purrr, that means good day, my lady. Can't believe he hasn't taught you any of his speech, Mistress Lyva... and on top of that he refuses to wear any jewels. Ah, but yes I am Nkom, Minor God of Gems. It is a pleasure to meet you Goddess of Metal and Greed. Purrr, aalos. Yes, I believe I said that all right."

The cat looked to Gon and the god of earth smiled at him. "Yes. You did."
