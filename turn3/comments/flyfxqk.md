It is not through gratuitous malice that the mortals have given the Salty Knave her collection of insulting sobriquets. It was through hardship after hardship that the mortals learnt how treacherous the sea could be. Even in the eons the Knave was asleep, the mortals kept attributing to her every misfortune that befell them at seas, from poor fishing hauls (causing them to probably call her something like Stingy Mistress) to disatrous storms and shipwrecks (which would lead to meaner names like Galley Gargler or something).

Any tribe, or civilization that ended up living  close to the sea, learnt to fear and respect the Knave, and especially those that lived in close relation with it, most likely for fishing, learnt to think of the most creative curses when it came to her.

As such, her worship didn't happen in the usual way, as even those who most respected her were completely disillusioned in the usefulness of prayers, as she in fact seemed to take great joy in taking advantage of those who most trusted her.

No, her worship was precisely in those nickname and curses, which, whether muttered or shouted ensureda great deal of thoughts and energy went into being upset at her, which, as any God knew, was just as good as any prayer.

Sometimes, she did have small altars or shrines in coastal settlements, but they were mostly a vicious mockery, or just a way to give a physical representation to the target of all that cursing.
