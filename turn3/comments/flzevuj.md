Sunda, who was exploring the land, took note of the goblins and their mountain. The land surrounding it was, to be blunt, boring.

He decided to fix that.

He padded around the mountain, circling the entire thing. With each step he sent out a wave of power, one that carpeted the surrounding landscape in green grass and hills.

The animals weren't, for the most part, anything special. He did, however, make sure to leave something of his own creation, for the natives to remember him by.

A large creature, Sunda decided, strong and powerful. Bears, he decided, would suit for a base. A sharp, powerful horn, not unlike that of a rhinoceros, was placed on their head. Armour, he decided, would help the bulky beasts. The armadillo, he found, sported something akin to natural armour, so he incorporated the design.

The end result was a very big, very powerful, beast that could charge straight into... quite a lot really. The, relatively, squishy underbelly was unfortunate, but some problems just couldn't be rectified.

That done he named the beasts, Beardillos, and set them free. When he was sure the new creatures could handle themselves he snuck down into the home of the goblins and whispered to them.

"See the great beasts above." He told them. "Gifts from Sunda, the Wild Lord."
