## Beautiful landscapes and creatures


The prismatic plains of proving 

Prismari had awaken after what felt like sleeping for forever 

Why did he sleep again and when did it happen. Was it the fight with Malaphet, Eh it didn’t really matter To him a nap was always good, he even grew a whole foot well he did... and it’s quite possibly  he gained some muscle mass, in his human form at the least 

Prismari had  a need to create and seeing as kain was still asleep or recovering from the Malaphet blasts he took, it was the perfect time for Prismari to be irresponsible 

He went to west of the great mountains range  and grand human shaped mountain. It was more boring forests, a jungle and some of the red plains. Prismari thought to himself that the red plains where the worse offend of this continent... why would someone make something one coloured. It was much better when there was more 

So Prismari wanting ti make a better plain went to work (-4 regional terraform west of the human shaped mountain) 

grass lands of prismatic grass and other shrubbery and flowers along with other plain plants and animals of various colours  (-4 to bioform I’ll compile a list of animals and plants later but basically normally plains animals and plants but colourful  ) 

Prismari also placed a special flower with in the plains called the mari flowers : flowers that looked like giant puff balls with pollen so think and dense that when disturbed it explodes into rainbow dust over everything and alters one perception of light messing with the visible colour spectrum, when a mortal eats a  portion of a mari flower the also experience a jolt of adrenaline for twelve hours that causes    a dulling or removal of the senses of pain depending on ones injuries along with a mild strength enhancement (-4 for the mari flower )
