# The River Bakwagalis

Yashqal looked upon the continent of Primus \[first continent\] and was bored by the lifelessness. While the lands west of the mountains sprang with prismatic life, the red plains had only birds and bugs, and the forests and jungles of the east were deathly quiet.

Yashqal dove through the heavens bearing down on the mighty mountain range, he smacked into its western rockface and cracked the solid stone. All over the eastern face, streams trickled down and meandered through the trees eastward to the ocean. Many of these streams joined into confluences, and these confluences rapidly became tributaries rushing into the thundering torrents of the River *Bakwagalis*.

The *Bakwagalis* started at the foot of the foot of the man-shaped mountain in a trickle and then snaked east, before doubling back and arcing north, crossing into the jungle, and zigzagging all the way up to the northernmost bay of the continent, where it emptied into the ocean.
