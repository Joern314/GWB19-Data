[Thank you. One more question: do you know why Reddit doesn't notify me sometimes when someone answers my comment? I assume from the fact that this turn opened that all of the events Sarah participated in have already ended, yet there's not a single notification to suggest someone commented on it despite the fact that the last time I checked, not all events concerning Sarah ended.]
