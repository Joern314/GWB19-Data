**Dreams of Divinity: Whispers**

*"Kuuuekzeklaal! Gegbesss esss rrrilolaal gbulg!"*

*The sky roiled as thunder echoed across the vast open plains, and Gon recognized the sent of rain on the gentle breeze that ruffled his feathers. Then, as if being eaten from the outside in, the vivid scene faded from Gon's view.*

*"Gbolo, gbolo." Voices from the blackness called.*

*"There you are... welcome back. Tch, there's no need to squirm." An unfamiliar voice announced happily. Gon tried to respond, but found he didn't even have the strength to lift his head to see the source of this mysterious voice. "Now, I am afraid I have some just awful news, you are going to be stuck with that scar forever, I think...  Yes, yes, sadly so... the blade has..."*

*Blackness once more.*

*"Rrrla, aalau sssegbauld sssegab."*

Gon awoke once more from a strange dream to find himself slumped against a cavern wall in the depths of Nkan'gbamo. Overhead the the high ceiling glittered as if it was the sky full of thousands of stars and in his lap sat the black blade of The Retaliator. On the back of his left hand a new rune wriggled, as expected.

"Stop? Why would I stop?" Gon questioned the mysterious dreams.

As consciousness steadily returned, Gon became aware of two new and strange feelings; a pull on his existence, something similar to what had tied him to his father and something else, some strange feeling of devotion, a following. Gon focused in on it and slowly he heard prayers, like faint whispers that seemed to carry some sort of power, a form of sustenance with them. It was as if the land and stone spoke to him. It felt wonderful, and he was hungry for some reason. Hunger. His old name.

"Sir!"

Gon nearly jumped out of his skin at the sudden voice. A pile of sand gathered into the shape of a man before him and saluted stiffly, or as least as stiffly as it could considering it was crumbling away.

"I have gathered the minor gods in the hall as ordered, sir!" Genaal'lakzek, the minor god of sand reported in a loud voice. "We have confirmed that we are no longer visible to mortals as well, sir! Just as you said, sir! General Mseligegbi is in disagreement with Miss Sralenkevo again, sir!"

From the audience chamber loud arguing could be heard between the minor gods of hatred and mercy. Gon had busied himself establishing dominion over the minor gods that tread on his control over the land. Sralenkevo, the Minor Goddess of Mercy was not one he wanted, but she had tagged along to pester him. She was the opposite of him, the denial of vengeance and always sought to temper his desire. Thankfully, the minor God of Hatred, Mseligegbi occupied much of her time with arguing.

Gon stood and left the inner sanctum to meet with the minor gods. The meeting went well, and he listened to their work and requests. It was good to have authority over others, he missed the feeling. Notable among the crowd that attended were; his favorite minor goddess, Livi of Lava, Rili of Balance, Sriuleg of Faults, and, last and certainly not least, Nkom of Gems.

...

Following the standard audience period and all of its usual chaos, Gon set out to observe the mortals, now reduced to what was termed the "stone age". Was it any wonder that many of the humans and a few of the Apokryphs worshiped him? Their world was built on stone; Lyva's domain would perhaps replace the tools they used one day, but for now everything they needed was made from stone. The arrows formed by the hunters made stronger with stone tipped arrows, a spear made from a stick hardened with flame served its purpose but it was so much better with a stone tip.

The stone knappers prayed to him that they would find the perfect stone and that they would break just right. Flint and obsidian were prized possessions and there was many who prayed to find them. They were all his. The gifts of the earth god to give as he pleased. The caves where they made their first homes too. Kzivo, one of Gon's servants had welcomed them into the shelter of the earth and crafted places to keep them dry and safe.

Knappers were an essential profession in the early world and if they wished for the stones to break it was best to pray to the god of the earth. Society relied on them, as simple as it was. Of more interest to Gon however, were those that braved the depths of caves with nothing but flickering torches.

Inspired by the legends of creation, brave mortals slipped into the caves to find the jewels under the mountains or a path to Lyva's hoard deep below the surface. Those who vanished forever were said to have stirred Gon's vengeance for trespassing on sacred ground, and those who returned with even small gems or shiny stones were said to be blessed by the God of the Earth. Tall tales circulated of visions of Kzivo moving in the shifting shadows of the caverns depths and sound of his work echoing through the caverns, almost certainly the slow drip drop of water from stalactites to stalagmites.
