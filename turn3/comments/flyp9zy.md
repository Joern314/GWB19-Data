Then she sat, curled her tail into a loop to make a portal, muttered, "Leyanna, Incomng!", and shoved the entire mound of clothes into her hoard. Then with grin, she stood, skin turning to hard black iron, hair wild like iron sand, and still hyper with the energy of her meal.    

"I can't exactly turn down such a deal as that, can I?" Lyva gave him a cool look like a snake ready to strike, then produced a long heavy flail from a hatch on her hip. "Just sit still, a day of trying clothes is nothing to an ancient god like us!"      

Then she charged, moving fast and ready to try and use magnetism to attempt to repel any stone he might throw her way.
