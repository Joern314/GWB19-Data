"Wonderful, Nkom needs a polisher!" The oblivious Livi replied happily. "I'd love to help, Mother Lyva!"

"Ooooh, your trying to get Father Gon to wear Nkom's clothing aren't you? How fun!" Livi said as she reappeared next to them and lit Gon's current robes on fire with her breath. "Can't wear them if they don't exist!"

"Livi, ah, ah, I liked these!" Gon complained.

"Oh, sorry, well you can make more." Livi continued to smile, and made a goofy salute. "Report: Father Sunda has created some nice grasslands. Now back to work!"

And with that Livi was off, just as soon as she had appeared. Gon struggled against Lyva's hold playfully.

"Don't just leave me like this!"
