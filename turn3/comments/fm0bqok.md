Kain sighed he expected much worse then this he expected to be dead he assumed he shouldn’t push his luck 

“Shadow was locked away for years by manus... is that not a judgment and punishment.... no it likely isn’t enough from all I have heard... 

But who’s to say I haven’t learned from the past just because I leave it as it is the past. Yes I have learned... it shaped me to be who I am... I help people be it god or mortal  because of the darkness my family has left... I will never fully scrub the family name clean. But my family... it is no longer what you remember... “ kain felt like he was wasting his breath 

“ even shadow and venmaric have gone on to help try saving the multiverse from time to time ... not that you would believe that rictus. But do know for the most part I will leave you and your humans alone... but if time should come when you or they need help... i likey will try my best.” Kain said zapping off in lightning before rictus decided he was good target practice 

Prismari sat on the ground taking everything in a lot of it went over his head 

“So kain is evil mr rictus? .... but he saved me from the void.” Prismari asked he was the most confused he had ever been sense being a wordless child
