#The savage Jungle

Azrakal saw the second continent being fairly empty, so he decided to create a land there.  
In to the land he gave his hatred and pain. It would be a blight on the land.

The land was a jungle with plenty of rivers going though it, starting to the south at the great cliffs and ending in the inland sea or ocean.  
For being a jungle it was somewhat sparse with it's trees, giving rise to more bushes.

The jungle was not a pleasant place, from the dark came the screams, the animals were vicious and violent. The plant life can kill you in an instant as several are poisonous. 

Flora: Several kinds of trees, vines and bushes. While several fruits exist, some are poisonous so be weary what you pick. It appears however that the berries are not poisonous, not a single species.  
There exist some crop plants, but a great amount of work would be needed in securing the area to farm it.

Fauna: The fauna of the jungle appears to be reptilian mostly, having several large dinosaurs like creatures.  
Kins that walk on both 4 and 2 legs.  
The predators are very bloodthirsty and will happily attack most things on sight.  
Even the herbivores can be dangerous, having horns and spiked tails to defend themselves. Some are even adapted to eat the poisonous fruits. Do not approach without care, as the herbivores will happily kill you too.   
While the large reptiles are certainly the most eye-catching fauna, there also exist smaller ones, they too are reptilian in nature.  
There is also plenty of insects, some carrying diseases, some are blood drinking kinds.

one notable animal is the a large raptor, unusually strong and quite eager to kill.  
It walks on two legs, more like a man than a beast, it's hands are set like hands with great claws in them. Highly intelligent but greatly enjoys the pain and bloodshed it cause.  
This creature is known as the **Blood Hunter**

The animals seems to have the **magic eating fungus** as well in them.

Food production: Meat, Fruit (some dangerous), crops
Resources: scales, exotic/dangerous animals, lumber, plant fiber.

[/u/smcadam, I presume second continent, north of the cliffs (area seems empty), also places it kinda same latitude as the other jungle.
