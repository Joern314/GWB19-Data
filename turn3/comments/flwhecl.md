Dawri was looking into the past of the world itself.

Around him the ground seemed to blur, and he was suddenly flung high into the air, entering space and drifting so that he could see planet, moon, sun and stars.

Then, the planet began to turn into the wrong direction, faster and faster, loosing its crust and being un-made before Dawri's eyes. Finally, the skull flew back into Malaphet's mouth, the darkness turned into void, and Lyva left the universe.

It was silent, but the strand continued.

Time accelerated even faster and faster, and blurry images revealed that Malaphet was vomiting... Something tentacled.

Then, even Malaphet and the mass of twisted apprentices vanished, leaving behind a void truly devoid of life. Eons passed.

With a minor "pop" a minor god appeared. They shrugged, looked around and asked a question, before vanishing again. The strand stopped, a frozen image of nothingness, showing the tiniest part of the despawning minor god, blurry yet lingering so close in front of him, remained. He had reached the very cause for this reality to be, and beyond this, only nothingness without fate or time could be found.

Dawri returned to the present, let go of the strand. There were more things to check out.

[I'll just assume you look at a minor god at some point]

He grabbed a minor god, and before the creature could squeak, the god of time already vanished.

He followed fate and time backwards, seeing the minor god attend to its tasks, until it climbed back into the large flower it had been born from. Then, an ordinary bird shot backwards onto the ground and looked at the flower, before again, the image froze.

[I'll assume you check out the divine power of mortals (sooner or later)]

Dawri picked some of his own powers, accumulated from worship brought by the collectors he had been forced to use as well in order to survive.

It was a crazy journey, full of colors and weird sensations, but Dawri managed to see some mortal, likely the producer, and how one of the collectors stealthily breathed onto the mortal, likely the moment of harvest. The mortal walked around a bit, praising the gods, especially Dawri for some reason, and the image froze over, part by part, as the strand grew thinner and thinner.

Returning back, suddenly the strand split, Dawri flung around, arriving at a nearby mountain. A minor god formed from rubble, a pick axe in hand. He begun to dig a cave, awakening a sleeping image of Gon. The strand ended, and Dawri had to carefully go back, take the other branch, and return to the present.

For now that was all he could find
