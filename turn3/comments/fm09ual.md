Nadeline cuddled up to the Dragon Goddess, and leaned in to whisper in her ear.

"You already know what I desire, babe..."

Then, she disappeared into the surf, and suddenly, the whole island was swallowed by massive waves.

When they receded, they had left behind new life onto the basalt shores.

Most noticeable was the long "treeline" of what were actually mushrooms, that grew very tall and with a flat head that cast a soft shadow over Lyva, which fed on the magmatic heat inherent in the isles. 

Under these fungoid forests, there was a plethora of insects and small life forms that could live comfortably enough in such a weird ecosystem. 

One "large" creature that instead found its home in this biome was a new type of bird, who fed on the small insects and built its nest inside the stalks of the giant mushrooms. It came in many bright colours and had quite a playful chirp. The first one that Lyva saw flew straight for her, nicked her earring, and took it to its nest.

The waves cackled at her.

"Well, it's up to you to name those birds, sweetheart... and the shrooms!"
