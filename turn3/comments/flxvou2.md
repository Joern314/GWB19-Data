#Recovery: Guiding the Tribes

Azrakal watched humans in the blood plains, they were a gathering and hunting society. Moving around the plains to hunt the deer roaming the land.

Life was not well for these nomads, it was difficult hunting the deer, even if you get one, a lot of the meat is lost. And the plains had little in terms of other food stuff.

Azrakal believed he could grow these simple nomads in to a powerful force.

Azrakal contacted one nomad, explained to him that there was a better way to gather food, and if he went down this path, his people would become, generations later, powerful people.  
The figure agreed and Azrakal taugh him to master the horse and tend to the deer.  
But that was not all, he taught him blood magic.

These nomads started to ride horses and herd deer. The acquiring of horses to ride made life much easier for them, not to talk about their deer herds.  
The ritual for killing a deer was important, as it gave them lot's of meat and furs to wear.
