Gon took the old tomes and pulled out a stone tablet as he flipped through them eagerly. He paused for a moment and glanced up to Lyva.

"You know, I am envious of you and Prismari sometimes... you know who you are..." Gon admitted quietly, before continuing to flip through the tomes as a smile worked itself back on to his face.

"Theoretically, from old worlds shouldn't work the same as it does here... it would stand to reason that this has something to do with the void we traveled through to get here... And yet..." Gon stopped at a page with a familiar pattern of suns and stars on it and tapped it. "... both Igki, uh, Hyla, and Nek were able to use a ritual from another existence to affect the nature of their divinity... I intended to use similar methods to steal my father's at one point... but how?"

Gon folded his arms and leaned back to look up at the ceiling that glistened with jewels and sighed. "When I met with Oryllia, she told me that she was made of some material she theorized could be greater than gods, Sunda seems to have been formed almost from our essences, that Kain fellow mentioned that his mothers found him somehow, and then there is the fact that he... somehow found Prismari out in the void..." 

Gon shook his head when he realized he was rambling. With a long look at the stone tablet, he flipped through a few more pages before sighing.

"Do... you think... it is possible to track something across the void?" Gon asked hesitantly, not fully sure he should involve Lyva.
