"I would seek to expand my dominion if it were up to me; why own just one universe if you can own many?" Gon replied to her question, revealing  no lack of ambition. If 8,000 years had changed Gon at all, then perhaps this was the first notable difference. He had spent time bringing minor gods to heel and seemed to have taken a liking to be in charge. 

"You can keep these for the time being; I'll take any excuse I can get to see you." he said with a smirk and a wink.

"I would love to show you around, my dear. It is not as glorious as I intend it to be yet and there is still much work to do. The Nkarlen will help with that somewhat." The gryn replied excitedly as he stretched and yawned after being pulled to is talons. "I am glad you like it. Let's start... here."

With a wild smirk, Gon grabbed her arm and pulled her into one of the walls of the cave. When they stepped out on the other side Lyva found herself in the audience chamber at the deepest parts of the temple-caves.

The room towered over the two deities in their humanoid forms; great square stone pillars, finely carved and glittering with gems divided the rooms into three parts and disappeared into a ceiling so high, that even with if there had been great fires burning in hall, only the reflections of the gems imbedded into the cieling would be visible.

As the goblins had not yet managed to venture so deep into Nkan'gbamo the hall was full of gloom such that from one end of the great hall one could not see the other end and the air was still and damp. Along the exterior walls stood empty nooks and smooth walls as if awaiting further work from gods or mortal hands. Large sections of the walls remained blank and devoid of jewels and were blank canvasses for further decoration. 

The middle aisle formed by the great stone sentinels that held up the ceiling acted as the approach to the stone chair that made up the throne of the cathedral like space. In place of what might have been a rug in other circumstances, there was instead an aisle made of jewels of all type in a great criss-cross pattern.

All of the floors, walls, and the shadowed ceiling were completely sooth to the touch and nowhere could one find any marks left by tools. Gon vanished from Lyva's side almost immediately after they entered the room only to reappear sitting in the plain stone chair upon a raised platform at one end of the hall and leaning on one elbow. Next to the chair one of the minor gods slumbered, a lion-like creature made of carved emerald with a mane of sapphire, eyes of garnet, and teeth and claws of diamond all giving of a dull radiance.

"Welcome, love, to Nkan'gbamo. Deep in the roots of the mountains it glitters. I felt it only proper to have someplace to dwell." Gon echoed from the stone throne.
