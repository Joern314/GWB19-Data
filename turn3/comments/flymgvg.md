**Glowing Caves of The Shattered Mountains.**

The second continent was completely barren - a fact that Gon found somewhat amusing considering that the Nkarlen didn't technically need anything and could just eat dirt and rocks - but he decided that the caves of the shattered mountains at least should have something in them to amuse the goblins, if nothing else. Nkom, the minor god of Gems had also presented a proposal for a strange crab-like creature, to remind mortals that all jewels belonged to him in the end. Gon figured he might as well make the underground pretty as well.

So, as Jikzek led his goblins deeper into the caves of Kzivo'gbamo above the glittering temple caves, Gon appeared to him once more.

"I return, Jikzek, to grant those who have followed you here another wonder. Witness."

Deep in the underground, there began to flourish all kinds of exotic species; strange glowing mushrooms that changed colors on a regular basis, bright green luminous algae that grew in wet areas of the caves, small shrimp like creatures who dazzled the goblins with their rolling display of bioluminescence along their sides, small trilobites that appeared to be painted in different luminous patterns, and invertebrates of all shapes and sizes that also carried some bioluminescence.

Strangest and perhaps most annoying among these critters was something the goblins termed a Nkelims'kzelir, or the Hoarding Crab. These strange hermit like crabs had exoskeletons of gray and brown that match the colors of the caves, but the back half of their body glows intensely and the gather up jewels and slowly craft them into shell like houses with mud and muck that when they occupy them causes them to glow through all the embedded colors like some crazy light show. These little creatures will take jewels from anywhere they can get them, including jewelry. If one manages to find one of their little nest holes, there is almost always a deposit of all kinds of jewels there.
