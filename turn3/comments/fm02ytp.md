# Forgiveness Pt. 1 [Beautiful Landscape]

After the collapse of the Ras'shallas Empire, the Yashool began going their separate ways. Some following the teachings of Yashqal, others wandering further into the Great Forest, seeking to live amongst the trees. This group of Yashool had become a nomadic people, wandering the Great Forest in search of a sign from their other creator, Thool, God of Trees. This nomadic group has called themselves the "Shagan", after the founder of their tribe "Shagantar". Thousands of years and dozens of generations have passed, but the oral history of the creation of their people had mostly survived, albeit there are many versions of this story. Over the years of wandering, again and again priests would beg for the divine intervention of Thool, to give them life without a home was the ultimate act of cruelty. A people destined to wander for an eternity surrounding by their primordial form. This was not the working of a benevolent god.   

Upon waking, Thool was tortured with the pleas for help from the Shagan, praying for a home. This constant misery tormented Thool. "I did not mean for this to happen" Thool thought. "What kind of patron leaves their creation to wander the plane in constant search of refuge?". Disappointed in themselves, Thool flew into a rage. All at once the weather began to change violently, bone-chilling cold and snow clashed with blistering heat and sunshine interspersed with beautiful springtime rain showers and crisp autumn winds, decimating the area in a perfect circle for several miles.

Then, for the first time ever, Thool split into all four forms, each present on the mortal plane at the same time scattered in every direction from the center of this circle. Winter, Autumn, Spring, and Summer all were at cardinal points of this perimeter. A blast has erupted from the center point, carving nearly three miles out of the earth in this circle. Either out of rage, disorientation from being split into four, or general confusion, each of the four aspects of Thool began to weep. The tears streaming out of each of these four created four waterfalls. These waterfalls congregated into a pool of freshwater encircling the basin of the newly carved basin.

Upon reforming into one entity, Thool descended to examine this new creation. Though this place was created out of anger, there was a certain beauty innate in this place; though it was rough around the edges, Thool knew what must be done. This would be the home his people had pleaded for. He would finally make right by them. Thool begun the work of making this crater into the cradle for their chosen people.
