"Excellent... Purr... No thank you, Mistress Lyva. I much prefer sleeping in the depths of the world." Nkom replied with a yawn. "Being treasured by people is so tiring, though the occasional polish is nice... purr... but if you should require help with some jewels, I will be here."

Nkom turned to Gon with what might have been something like a smile. "You look good, My lord. Miss Lyva has told me that she loves you in that outfit. She whispered it to me, but I would be not doing my duty if I kept secrets from you. May I go now?"

Gon mumbled something to himself and replied. "I suppose."
