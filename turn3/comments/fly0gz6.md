"It is right to judge you on your inaction! After the world burned and order was restored instead of helping the world heal you chose to run away and hide instead of facing the legacy you murderous bitch of a mother created. May she rot in the city of ash. There is such a thing as civic duty! I know that not all eggs in your family are bad! Just look at the Nameless! He fought the Shadow, Venmaric and your whole wretched family! And if I had judged you, I would have proclaimed the verdict here and now and sunk this sword into your guts on the spot. I do however not have to like you or the fact that you are here." Rictus countered still angry and ignoring Prismari.
