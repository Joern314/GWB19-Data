**Carved from Stone**

“Hrrm…” Gon yawned and cricked his neck as he eyed his latest experiment. Being a true divinity had a nice feeling, but he would need some servants in the mortal realm. If he had learned anything from Lyva, he should make someone else do the menial tasks. He needed some servants, preferably expendable, and they might as well have souls. The stone creature he had fashioned was small, but it seemed familiar to him. Gon wondered if creating mortals came naturally to divines, it seemed to be far easier than he expected, almost like he had done it before.

“Msoll, naal legglo srreond… logs miko samo malo!”

Gon slammed his hands to the ground next to the statue of the short goblin and pulled out two copies and then two more until the mountain top was a small forest of the things. Each was a little different.

“Now then, you are called... Nkarlen.” The god laughed and clenched his fist. “Lets get some life into you. Nka nkog no samo sauls!”

Gon punched down into the mountain and caused a massive earthquake that split open a deep crevice into the land near the bottom of the mountain. The mountain shed the small forest of goblin statues from its peak with a great racket. They tumbled down the mountain side and into the deep chasm that had formed there. From this deep abyss the first Nkarlen climbed back out into the world only to immediately find themselves not fond of the light.

Gon was amused as the new little beings set out on a quest to find caves to hide in while others tried to catch game by crawling up to them as silently as possible and still others settled down into a meal of rocks. When none of them seemed to react to his presence, he laughed and pulled The Retaliator from its scabbard at his side.

“Oh right. Can’t interact with mortals now, so let’s see if we can change that.”

The blade was now immaterial; not powered by any force and so in a way not even real. In theory at least. Gon stepped up behind a goblin that had taken a liking to a particularly shiny stone and had managed to fight off five others for it. With a quick motion, Gon shoved the blade through the goblin’s back with a smile. Sure enough, the blade passed clean through the creature, who, other than reaching around to scratch his back, seemed no worse for wear.

“You will hear me… gboil no.” The vengeful god whispered harshly as he poured some power into this creature through the immaterial blade. “You owe me a favor after all.”

The muddy grey skinned goblin jumped up and rounded on him, still clutching the shiny stone and ready for a fight. It stared up at Gon in amazement.

“You! What you? A stranger! Fine-Feathers? This my rock. How you get so big? And claws? I want claws.” The goblin babbled as he looked at his feet and back to the earth god. “I think trade for fine feathers. I make hat like yours. You friend, Seglingol?”

“Ah, yes… of course.” Gon lamented, realising that language wasn’t further developed. He put on a smile.  “What is your name? ”

“Name? What that?  Others call me Shine-Thief. But I no steal. I found. My ro-”

“Forget it, forget it. You are... Jikzek for now. Got it? You. Jikzek.” Gon dictated to the gray goblin while pointing a finger at him as if to emphasize the meaning before slapping himself on the chest. “ I am Gon Gryn the God of Earth and Vengeance and the creator of you Nkarlen. The... big feathered one, understand? I have come to collect my payment for your creation and I have chosen you, Jikzek, to be allowed to see me and act as my messenger.”

The goblin scrunched its crooked nose then cackled and relaxed. “I see. You different because you god. You haven’t come to steal stone... Right?”

“I am god of all of the stones; Nkad Nkan asr Oiligegbo. What use do I have for one? But I haven’t come just to talk. Take whoever will follow you and head that way. Follow the mountains to the end of the chasm where you will see the Skaal’gbaldol, the Nkarlen hero that gave his life to become the stone that holds up the sky. In that place you will find Kzivo’gbamo; sharp caves that twist into the shattered mountains where one of my servants dwelled in ages past. Seek deeper into those caves and you will find my home, Nkan’gbamo, full of glistening gems - shiny stones - and fine rooms where I dwell and rule. Take my people there and you will have many shiny stones in your future, Jikzek. That I can promise you.”

So the prophet of vengeance set out with all of the Nkarlen that would follow him, guided by Gon when they drifted off course because of their poor sense of direction or understanding of the young world, leaving a few behind at the site of their birth which they named Nkloig Sekzil, The Mouth of Creation.

Mortals: Nkarlen, the Cave Goblins

Description:

The Nkarlen are a race of four to five feet tall agile pointy-eared humanoids with crooked noses and angry looking eyes. They are extreme omnivores and will attempt to eat anything and everything. They have incredibly strong teeth and stomach acid and can therefore eat even small rocks. Created by a god of vengeance, they have a tendency to never forget even the smallest slight. When this is combined with their natural lack of sympathy, they can become hell-bent on payback. They are short-lived - their average max life span is only 40 years - but they breed like rabbits; it is common for one pair of goblins to have ten to twelve children.

They have a naturally agile and skinny physique allowing them to slip through their caves and holes quickly. Their skin is usually a mottled gray/brown, but extended exposure to light turns them green. Those goblins who never leave their caves often develop darker brown skin to the point where it is almost black. Their voices usually range from shrill to guttural with nothing in between. Goblins with normal voices are rare.
