"How in all the stars did you make something air headed?" Lyva giggled and kissed him as she pulled his head through the tunic, "I... hmm, I don't mind that."       

She gasped slightly at his grip, and frowned, glancing back at her two writhing tails in puzzlement, "I... mmm, five minutes ago? Yesterday? While we were chasing, I don't know, time's strange now."    

Lyva whipped her tail free and wormed his arm into a sleeve, focus shifting as she coiled the two tails together into a single appendage once more, then divided it again experimentally, and shrugged. "I'm a goddess, it's no wonder, I can be as I please. Honestly, I think I'm... I don't know, *mature* now, my other self is around as large as my Mother now, or our mysterious sun serpent. A full grown mature goddess."    

"Hey, Nkom, come see, I want a nice fitting emerald dress like this!" She added as she shoved his other arm into a sleeve and pulled the tunic down to his knees.
