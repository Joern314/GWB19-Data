###Tsukumogami, or Familial Bonding

Items gain power based off the time that it spends with its owner who gives special care and attention to it (Whether positive or negative). Items can be passed on to family members which regress the years to halfway through the previous phase (Excluding the final phase). For all intents and purposes aside from worship, items that have bonded to the 100+ years phase are mortals.
