###Recovery: Guiding the Tribes

Outside the Rift the Apokryph had in olden times established the Magocracy or a crude forerunner thereof. With the decline of the gods and the loss of much of their magic the magocracy faded into legend and their magic was forgotten. Their Apokryph ancestors however, reduced to barely a barbaric tribe, still new many of the stories of old, how the Sorcerer and Lyva had created them, how Ragos the tyrand of the bloody empire had be dragged to death by the god and many more.

The primary reminder for them of who their patron was were the masked and hooded figures coming from the Rift. They were mortals and Apokryphes without a doubt. But after a number of people had died invariably the Rift Keepers as they were referred to by the Apokryphs of the material plane. The Rift Keepers carry the glowing fruit of the crystaline Rift Trees. 

And as the Rift Keepers pass by the souls of the dead start to follow them and all mortals can watch as a procession of ghosts walks towards the Rift.
