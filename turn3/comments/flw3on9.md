Dawri nodded, humming curiously. He looked around at the air, as though there was a bug buzzing about through the air. He reached out, and hooked a finger on something and tugged. Suddenly, a glimmering thread glistened into existence in the air a few centimeters out from Dawri's finger before vanishing into nothingness, yet the strand still remained taut, as though it continued farther.

Dawri tugged a bit harder on the strand, as though testing its strength, then seemed to nod, and stepped forward, still gripping the strand. Dawri then seemed to violently vibrate, then vanish.

Metaphysically, Dawri rode the strands of Fate and Time, following the past of the world until he could find some piece of information surrounding the metaphysical structure of the Gain and Draw of this realm, and what it might have been that was affecting it.

[Joern, what does Dawri see?]
