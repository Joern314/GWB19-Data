The goblins, being a young and very curious race, could not resist creeping up from their dark caves to see what this whispering voice had told them, only to be amazed by the suddenly vibrant grasslands before them. The world they had known had been barren before they entered the caves.

The first encounter with a Beardillo came as quite a shock as it charged down the mountain side and into the first group of explorers. Goblins, being, well, goblins cackled at the first victim as he was hurled into the air and scattered while trying to pelt the thing with rocks, to little avail.

Unable to do damage to the creature, trying to get on its back became a sport, and no less than 15 goblins met there end in the encounter, before on managed to climb up on the things back as it grew tired. It of course flung him off in seconds, and bounded away from the gathering crowd, but the goblin was forever after remembered as Roilenkar, Beardillo Rider. A local legend.

The bodies were dumped uncerimoniously down the Mouth of Creation.
