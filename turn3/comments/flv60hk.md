*She felt rich and sated.    
Lyva curled amidst the molten remains of her hoard, wrapped within the planets core. She could smell Gon and Prismari. They were doing things. They weren't sleeping.    
But it was comfy here so she shifted her scales, resting her draconic head on her back, and dozed some more.     
There was more. What were they doing? Didn't they know they were going to starve if they spent their power, robbed by minor gods to make minor gods to make minor gods?    
It had irritated her to discover that the Serpent was correct. She did have to wait things out and sleep. Any other solution was too risky, rewriting the metaphysics could fail and leave her dead. Better to just sleep, even with her hungry stomach growling for worship.    
It had stopped growling. She could feel murmurs of prayers, of songs.*

The Gelbrous Tribe of the Vast Jungle worshipped Lyva for community. She taught them to trade rather than steal, maim and conquer. Of course people had stolen, maimed and conquered over the years, but when did it ever work out long term? The legend of the Blood Empire just proved it.    
In comparison, tracking debts and roles didn't end in bloodshed. The tribe working together held strong and continued, passing down for generations. Others worshipped Lyva for MORE- for better summers, more game, more forage, and even discoveries of ancient hard trinkets stronger than stone that they called Metal. Arrowheads, spearheads, necklaces were rare relics to the Gelbrous and the other tribes of the jungle.
