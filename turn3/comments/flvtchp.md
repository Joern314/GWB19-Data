"Acceptable targets in my opinion." Gon joked happily, finding her presence wonderful after such a long time apart. He crouched down next to Lyva and smiled at the display.

"I wasn't aware you helped with the Apokyphes. Does the death god remind you of your father?" Gon couldn't help but ask with a laugh. "You have done a good job too... I am sorry I killed a few here and there."

"Maybe I am a natural, but there are admittedly some odd similarities between them and the Arakyl... I don't remember anything from how he made them... thinking about it, now... it is almost like he tried to cross Gryn and Nkarlen." Gon laughed and smiled.

"No luck on memories from before I was in that world... Lyva... Did you have any dreams while you were asleep?" Gon tried to ask nonchalantly. His dreams concerned him, but he didn't want to worry Lyva over nothing.
