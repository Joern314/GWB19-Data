Irritated at the claims of her bearing Sunda, Lyva focused part of her essence on sending a message. She felt out for those who only partially served her, those who worshipped them both, and waited until the shaman's in question began to speak of Sunda's origins.    

Lyva, the sun, a beast and the sky laying together? She growled in fury, and turned her tail to a serpent head, quickly biting the shaman and his followers in the neck. Like dominoes the shaman and his men collapsed, suddenly dead with just a single bite on their necks, their souls trapped within her. That ought to correct things, and so Lyva turned her attention away from the matter.
