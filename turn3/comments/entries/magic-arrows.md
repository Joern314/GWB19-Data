### Magic Arrows[magics]

Info: /u/Horatius-Cocles [Turn 0](/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/fluouup/)

Magical Arrows who can absorb magical energies upon killing something, so it does not explode. Magical energy is stored in the arrow until discharged. This is a secret magic and does not become general knowledge. Can only be learned by bargaining with Rictus or buying it directly for 3 acts + 2 acts for secrecy.
