  "content": "**Creator**: The Sorcerer\n\n**Amended**: -\n\n**Description**: In accordance with the laws of thermodynamics energy can not be created or destroyed only displaced and transformed. The energy of life permeating mortal bodies does not fade with death.\n\nIn animals the energy once keeping them alive turns into magical energy. The one and only source for everything magical. This magical energy has only a very short halflife and dissipates into the surrounding world as light and heat energy.\n\nOnce a mortal has reached the end of his/her/its natural life span or is killed in another way the soul is separated from the body. The body however does not die off. It is transformed into a so called \u201cUnliving\u201d.\n\nThe Unliving are feral beings not unlike zombies, but instead of rotting they are functionally alive bodies without minds beyond those of primitive animals only set on sating their base desires like food, drink and procreation.\n\nIf an Unliving is killed its animating force turns into magical energy as well. The transformation from magical energy to heat and light occurs in seconds. An Unliving explodes with the force of a grenade and the smaller the animal the less force/ magic is released.\n\nTo kill an Unliving its brain needs to be destroyed. Any parts attached to the head stay active.\n\nUnclaimed souls and those claimed by the Sorcerer are after death escorted to the afterlife in the \u201cRift\u201d, the Sorcerer's plane, by the mortals inhabiting the Rift and only those inhabiting the Rift.\n\nThe Unliving yearn to sate all their animal desires including food, sleep and sex at all costs. They are however biologically mortal and produce mortal children.",
