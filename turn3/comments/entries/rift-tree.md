### Rift Tree[lifeforms]

**Description:** Rift Trees don't have a fixed form. They can bee gnarly and weather-beaten, as high as mammoth trees or shaped like giant mushrooms. The single thing they have in common is they are all made from Rift Crystal. Plantlife tends to grow bigger and faster near Rift Trees. The curious forms the Rift Trees take in a patch of Rift Woods stem from these auras, speeding up plant growth, overlapping.

Rift Trees survive and spread by consuming matter and ambient energy and can thereby grow in any environment providing these. The presence of Rift Trees cools down the temperatures of their surroundings and makes it thereby easier for a patch of Rift Wood to spread.

Once in a time a Tree will spawn a glowing pear shaped Rift Fruit. If a fruit is planted alone in a field a single Rift Crystal Tree will sprout. To get rid of a Tree one has to sever all the roots of it. In a patch of Rift Wood the roots of the Rift Crystal Trees grow together and connect to each other forming in essence one giant Rift Tree.

The Trees themselves look like described above only carved from blue or violet crystals and grow at the entrances to the Rift or in the Rift itself naturally. 

The fruit of the glows and be fashioned into a lamp, used by the Rift Keepers to guide the souls of the dead along to the afterlife.
