**Oneiros, the City of Sleep**: At the center of the plane, suspended in mid air, hovers a white city, Oneiros, the city of sleep. Here those who have earned a reward, dream away the time. It is also the primary home of the Apokryph in the Rift.

**Endless Woods**: A woodland haunted by those deemed unworthy to enter Oneiros. It is overrun by the nightmares of the Damned, who are forced to prey on each other for eternity. The topography and geography is permanently shifting and the Woods are shrouded in near complete darkness.

**Rift Woods**: Patches of crystalline tree like structures that grow in wooded areas on land or coral reefs under water. They can be found in the material plane and the Rift. These patches of crystalline woods mark the entrances/exits of the Rift.
