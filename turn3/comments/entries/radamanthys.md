### Radamanthys[minor-gods]

Info: /u/Horatius-Cocles [Turn 0](/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fr5ib1/endless_pantheon_turn_3/fluou5m/)

A human-like bearded minor god. He is the Judge of Judges. Deliberating on who was worthy to receive the powers of an Iron Judge and to use them responsibly.

And upon finding such a person and establishing that their city, nation, region or even general area was in need of the protection of the Iron Law, that person would be granted the powers of an Iron Judge.
