  "content": "These are the old Apokryphes choosing to mostly stay in the Rift. They have seen other realities and are weary of the world. But they do run through reincarnation all the same, their souls just never leave the Rift anymore, unless they are sent to collect the souls of dead people from the prime material plane.\n\nIf they do this duty they are hooded and cloaked, faced hidden behind masks. They carry lanterns of Rift Tree fruit to guide along the dead. \n\nRift Keeper society largely follows the conventions laid out by the Sorcerer for the future (See nations \u2013 Magocracy).",
