Their hair colors range from white and gray over brown to black. The Apokryph are born with dark runic markings on their bodies. These markings change with the stories of their life's. \n\nThe Sorcerer and his clergy can read these markings to determine the caste an Apokryph belongs to. As these markings change the stations and powers of an Apokryph, his or her station change in life and Apokryph-society. They also have horns to comemorate the hand of Lyva in their creation.\n\nIn their veins flows a great amount of magic extending their natural life spans up to 300 years. Additionally they have innate magical powers making them more adapt at the jobs their caste is tasked with, as Apokryph society is intended by their original creator to be a caste structure. Currently the Apokryph can however not access their life spans and innate magic as they are not yet accustomed to life in this new world.",
