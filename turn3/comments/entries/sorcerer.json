His eyes are representative of a dark night sky filled with stars.\n\n**Plans and Style:** Magic, Death and the Afterlife are linked. Expect to see as much in-game.\n\n**Origin:** The Sorcerer was once the prophet of a god of magic and darkness before he rose to the rank of a demigod and finally ascended to full godhood. In the absence of his once patron deity, he himself took over the leadership of his people. And now he wanders the multiverse in search of a new world that could make an apt permanent home for his people, after their erstwhile world suffered catastrophe after catastrophe.\n\n**Further Explanation:** The Sorcerer was once an idealistic youth trying to follow in his patron's footsteps to be a force of good. Repeated betrayals by his closest allies have made him pragmatic and weary and have shifted his focus from looking out for everyone to looking out for his people.",
