#### The Magocracy[nations]

The Magocracy may in future live up to its potential and become the grand nation of magic. But for now they are not more than a primitive tribe with a primitive village led by a shaman. And the caste system only crudely observed.

Though following the Sorcerer's plans the Apokryphes will in time transform their society into the Magocracy, building a nation on the material plane akin to the society of Apokryphs as established in the Rift.

With their caste society having religious and cultural meaning. No caste is higher than another in social standing. They just serve as crude way to determine one's vocation in life. Administration, sciences and works of pure intellect are done by the Philosophers. The Guardians are the defenders of the nation and work in every way the defense of the nation requires from military service and training to espionage and other less unsavory practices of war and politics. The citizens do the day to day work. Although money plays never a large role in the nation. Money is mostly frowned upon and only used to trade with foreigners.. The mages are a casteless part of society involved in all workings their help and presence is needed.

People carry a private name for personal use and a public use-name. People who distinguish themslves are given titles by the leaders of society like The Guardian or The Warrior.

As in the Rift the nation is supposed to be governed by the Inner Council. Where all Apokryphes castes and all cities contribute a councilor. The Circle is lead by the First Councilor whose job it is to break ties in votes. The Circle is advised by the mages

While all forms of art are a trade for the Citizen case the pursuit of art and knowledge in their freetime is encouraged. The masks nearly all citizens wear not only carry marks of their station in society, but can also be customized to a degree and are the prime opportunity for Apokryphs to show their artistic skills.

The nations of the Apokryphs have in many worlds left their mark by being the biggest exporters of enchanted wares and no one says they can not do it again.
