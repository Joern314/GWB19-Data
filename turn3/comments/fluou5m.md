### The Iron Law [Miracles]

At any time there are a number of individuals (number will grow with time and a bigger population), chosen by Radamanthys the minor god of judges. 

People found worthy by Radamanthys gain knowledge of the law as laid down in Rictus' Iron Codex. Most people can only use the powers of an Iron Judge to enforce the Iron Law as laid down in the Iron Codex.

But due to an unexpected interference between the blood metaphysic making people more powerful and the strange metaphysics of this new world, Iron Judges who gain positions as nobles, kings, high government officials, etc gain the ability to interpret the Iron Law more flexible or in very rare cases to choose another altogether different set of laws of their own choosing to enforce.

While most people chosen by Radamanthys will stay their course and stick to the Iron Law, the power may corrupt some few individuals who use their powers not in the service of the Iron Law, but for themselves or their chosen codices of law. It falls to the Iron Inquisitors to root out these corrupt judges.

Iron Inquisitors are tasked with special duties by the god Rictus, among the most important is the neutralizing of renegade Iron Judges, who don't use their powers for justice and in unethical ways.

The Iron Judges, in turn, are bound to the strict nature of the Iron Law and are provided with knowledge of how to interpret the Law correctly and in extension how to give and render judgment correctly. After an impartial investigation of course. If a judge fails to comply with this, he is stripped of his rank and judged by an Iron Inquisitor accordingly to the Iron Law and replaced by an individual found worthy to serve. The ousted former judge then loses all his powers.

The Law is independent thereby subject to no one and to be obeyed by all. The Judges by extensions are only subject to the Iron Law, and while they may choose to worship any god and follow any mortal individual they desire, they still have to render judgment even of their king if the Iron Law demands it. 

By extension, the Judges are not susceptible to being mind-controlled or influenced even by the divine. While a god can still smite a judge, if they wish to do so, they can not in any other way interfere with a judge's work. The free will and action of a judge can NOT be tampered with under any circumstances in as far as it pertains to his duties as an Iron Judge. Their free and honest judgment in accordance with the Iron Law is a judge's first duty.

While in an ideal world everyone would live by the rule of law, many people or their gods don't support the Iron Law [yet].

The Law and its judges can render judgment on anyone who breaks the Iron Law. To do this the Judges are given the power to make reality around them conform to the Iron Law.
For example, if the Iron Law forbids the carrying of weapons, the presence of an Iron Judge would make it impossible to bear arms. Anyone carrying a weapon would find themselves unable to lift or draw the weapon. The Iron Judge would then proceed to the judgment and the meting out of punishment for the transgression of bearing arms. For a judges powers to take effect they need to proclaim a verdict by any reasonable form of communication, meaning even writing and sign language would work.

To use this power however an Iron Judge has to know one of the Iron Laws is broken. He has to be near the infraction to fix it and using this power is taxing. The greater the change to reality, the greater the fatigue a judge incurs after using this power. This can even lead to death.

However, if the cause of an infraction is supernatural the power can be fueled by energies of the supernatural entity/ magic that said infraction is coming from, not taxing the judge as much in using their power.

The only circumstance under which judgment/ punishment can be avoided to be given by an Iron Judge is to prevent greater and heavier consequences than letting crime go unpunished.

Lastly fast and swift action is often necessary. If there is a threat too big to be handled by Iron Judges or to the Iron Law itself an Iron Inquisitor can be called. Iron Inquisitors carry all the powers of the Iron Judges are for the duration of their missions however exempt from judgment themselves. They can, however, be judged after their missions are finished and their status as Iron Inquisitors revoked.

In a state of extreme emergency, where the Law isn't only threatened but can be considered non-existent because of the reigning disorder. An Iron Inquisitor can name Lawbringers.

Lawbringers are endowed with the power to actively bend reality to bring order into chaos. Where the Iron Judges can only bend reality to conform to law, a Lawbringer can bend reality to what it should be in the Lawbringer's eyes.

These powers can be revoked by an Iron Inquisitor or withdrawn by the miracle itself, if grossly misused.

The strain put on Lawbringers is the same or even greater as that put on Judges, when they bend reality.

### Radamanthys [Minor Gods]

Info: /u/Horatius-Cocles  [Turn 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/GodhoodWB/comments/fpv868/endless_pantheon_turn_2/fltekq0/)

A human-like bearded minor god. He is the Judge of Judges. Deliberating on who was worthy to receive the powers of an Iron Judge and to use them responsibly.

And upon finding such a person and establishing that their city, nation, region or even general area was in need of the protection of the Iron Law, that person would be granted the powers of an Iron Judge.
