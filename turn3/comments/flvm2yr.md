Lyva was unprepared for the change, her blade was knocked aside, she stumbled back, slipped under his swing and dropped her shield to smash against his blade. Then the lightning stung her hands, twitched the muscles, and the zescite blade suddenly flew from her grasp.    

"Ah," Lyva breathed, darting backwards, and grinned with sharp teeth, "Now we're getting revved up!"      

Then in a blur of motion, she lunged forwards and taught the bismuth sword in her teeth, changing as she did so. Dark blue tungsten turned to bright gold, her form shifted as if molten and lashed out, longer and greater and vaster, and yet seeming less part of its surroundings.   

"Dear? Where did you go?" Lyva purred in her draconic form, glancing around in confusion while the blade still jutted from between her fangs, seeming to barely put together something felt off. To Prismari it was far more obvious, time had aged Lyva just as it had him, perhaps quadrupling her titanic serpentine self, so that she now loomed as large as Celastra had in her maturity.
