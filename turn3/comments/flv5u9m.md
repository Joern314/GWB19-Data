The Zepho tribe 

The tribe of zepho where a nomadic people who lived with a former nomadic tribe that had  recently settled  the prismatic plain, the zepho tribe unbeknownst to them are the descendants of the mortals saved by Prismari ,Sarah and kain form Malaphet and where in possession help the knife of Zephon the demon slayer (-3 for a hero artifact knife that when in the presence of demons cause the user to gain strength) the knife had been past down for generations and legend had it a chosen hero of Prismari once weld it in battle  

As the tribe settled the new colourful area they seemed to be set upon by a pack of colourful wolves night after night yet the chiefs with the knife of a former hero long lost to time along with his tribes warriors where able to hold them off, this went on for two weeks until all hope was lost the chief had fallen ill after taking a a wolfs bite to the leg. And so the men seemed out witted by the beast with out the commander as the packed closed in colourful lightning hit the ground (-2 contact mortals ) 

There where the lightning hit a young teenage boy stood, those this boy was wrong his hair was a very many strange colours and the fur he wore was strange it didn’t look like fur at all , he gave them a wave causing them to see his prismatic eyes and turned to the colourful wolves 

Prismari though to himself he rather not kill the wolves he just made them not to long ago, but in the end mortal life matter more. So he ran forward a little clumsily still adjusting  to his new muscle mass. He picked out what looked to be the alpha of the wolves and targeted it with a swift kick of god like strength it was sent flying into the air, Prismari the grappled the closest one to him and in a show of strength snapped its neck 

Wolves are not stupid creatures and seeing this show of force the started to back off, but Prismari wasn’t done dropping the second he moved on to the third then the fourth after the fifth pack member of seventeen went down the wolves retreated and prismari approached the mortals 


“I’m Prismari god of heroes ! I won’t tell you to bow but I will commend you and your leader for you have fought as well as any heroes would! 

All those amongst you may one day have the chance to grab a fragment of possibility and become a true hero, if this change ever present it self you will be embraced in legend forever ! And it would be because of me ! 

So what say you will you fallow me along with the storm lord kain... bring of the storm both destructive and needed “ Prismari said adding on the bit about kain to be safe 

The men who just an hour ago where faces a pact of wolves now where looking at a blood covered child who had just single handily saved the new village and so the men bowed and promised to fallow there saviour 
And soon the name  of Prismari and kain began spreading thought out the tribe
