Nkom shuffled under her touch, slowly getting her to rub it elsewhere. Wherever she did, she noticed that the cat would grow shinier as if she was polishing it. It merely purred under her touch, and seemed to be unable to talk while being so polished. Eventually he had to force himself a short distance away to respond.

"Well... since the master won't wear them..." The lion responded with a flick of its tail and threw its head back to let out an echoing roar. A massive pile of clothes, apparently all made of gemstones, appeared between him and Lyva. Crowns, bracers, an odd form of greaves meant to fit avian legs, a mail shirt made of rings of diamonds, sapphire pauldrons, somehow soft emerald shirts, velvety ruby robes, and even a few pieces of the same part of clothing as if the minor god had tried many different gems and styles to get Gon to wear any of it.

Gon looked wide-eyed at the pile. "Aalau kobeg gegbig?!"

"He's surprised I kept all of this." Nkom translated flatly and looked at Gon with a yawn. "Well I thought master might change his mind. The Mistress Lyva can keep it better than I can. It is not my job to keep things."
