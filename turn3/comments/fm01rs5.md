"The past is never gone. Just because it happened before, it does not mean that it should be forgotten or forgiven. I am Rictus, the god of law and hunt. Hunting those how break the law is within my spheres. Punishing them for past transgressions is what I do. The past can be forgotten and forgiven, but only if the just sentence is served. And just because the Shadow in the end opposed his other brother, does not mean that its and its families transgressions make up for all the harm they caused. And if you have not learned that the past shapes the future by now! And the horrors of the past always come back to haunt us! Then you are delusional! Before you look to the future, look to the past!" Rictus growled. "There will be no peace between us as there is no peace between lion and sheep. Stay out of my way! And know that if you plan to perpetuate your family's vile legacy, my sword will come down on you as it did on the Shadow! Stay out of the Hunting Grounds and out of the way of humanity! Your offer of restitution is to the wrong one." And then he turned to Prismari. "I would advise you to separate yourself from this creature. Go! Find a world of your own! Far away from the Shadow's brood! Their ilk invariably corrupts everything they touch!"
