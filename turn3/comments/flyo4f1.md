"A little silly, but I can picture you looking absolutely stunning if you have a properly fitted one." Gon laughed at her enthusiasm and smiled softly. Nkom blinked at the question and looked to Gon.

"Purr... if master gives me permission... Da Ig gbivo ga?" He 

"You got yourself into this one; you don't really think I would let you get off that easy, do you?" Gon replied with a laugh. "Plus, she is my mistress, so you should want her to look as good as me."

Nkom turned back to Lyva and stared for a moment.

"Very well... I will do this for you, mistress Lyva, but I must ask you to do something for me." He spoke smoothly. "Master Gon created me from all of his ideas for gems, and yet he refuses to put on any of these things. To get him just to wear that bracelet and those jade green robes took centuries."

"H-hey, wait a minute! Aalau dan-" Gon protested as he realized where this was going. Nkom seemed to almost smile and his velvety voice had the slightest him of mischief in it.

"Na molkzaal. Get him to wear one of these things and I will make an equivalent for you."
