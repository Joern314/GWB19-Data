Prismari looked over the minor god as she appeared, he found all the minor gods creepy something about them didn’t sit right with him 

“ you you keep her inside of you !!! “ Prismari said with a whisper  as he leaned in to lyva ear “are you sure you trust that thing inside of you....” he asked very quickly 

Then he looked back to leyanna “ I had it just the way I liked it in there before I got separated for my love... you better not have messed with anything.” Prismari said with a large laugh 

“ I have never been good at keeping track of time so I’ll have to take lyvas words for it that a week has past.” He said sticking his tongue out at leyanna
