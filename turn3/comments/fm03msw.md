Lyva cursed, blinked, then smirked at Livi in a very unmortherly way, "Bounding with energy, little one! Thankyou for keeping the core flowing during my nap, though I just met Nkom so you do have competition as my favourite now- urgh, hold still!"    

She grimaced, and let the heat flow through her, solid iron form glowing bright orange and less solid. Then in a very Prismari-like move, she suddenly split and flowed around Gon, reforming with her knee in the small of his back, tails restraining one arm, the other still trapped in her molten abdomen.    

"We're playing dress up Livi, want to help?" She added, spitting up a litre of molten rock to try and vent her hoard somewhat, and began stripping off Gon's not jewel clothing.
