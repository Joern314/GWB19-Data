####The Great Ocean Biome     

The Great Ocean is abounding in microscopic life, particularly algae and plankton that form the basis of its food chain. Larger species like the **Kymen Algae** bond together into long serpent like chains, that can sometimes stretch dozens of metres long during the day.        
Larger plants dominate the sea bed, with many varieties of sea weed and brine trees making food via photosynthesis and even developing fruits of sorts in order to spread. In the deeper regions, **Molt Fields**, large fungi claim energy from geothermal activity instead, and cover the seabed near volcanoes in a coppery thorny field.      
Some species of coral and anemone can be found in the shallows, but there is not currently the variety needed for coral reefs. [I figure that's worth a seperate biome]    

The vast majority of fauna in the ocean is herbivorous, with fish being the most common- species like tuna, salmon, haddock, herring, pike- along with **Gildfish** who stick shiny objects to their adhesive scales, **Hylatlung**, long sea snakes with a head at either end of their bodies, and **Fareehans**, gigantic fish on a scale with whales who sift and consume plankton.     
Jellyfish, octopi, celaphopods, crabs and arachnids, sea scorpions, diving birds and eels survive primarily on scavenging, but are too fragile to properly hunt and kill prey.     
Predators of the ocean include **mertlings**, feral half ape half serpent creatures, **farwhals** with long lance horns, **shield sharks** with armoured bony skulls and maws, **Ripple Swarms** who are small hive minded fish that sacrifice a few with every meal, sometimes causing horrific chain explosions, **caprimer** who are shaggy, goat fish hybrids, **leonmer** which are shaggy beasts covered in symbiotic weeds, and **trilalungs**, large winged rays with long tails who can glide above the water.     

The main biohazard of the ocean is **Netterkin**, a large sea snake with poisonous skin, horns and a resemblance to a serpentine dragon.
