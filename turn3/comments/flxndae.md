# The Wastes of Pain

Oryllia looked down at the world beneath her. There wasn't enough pain there. "Blight, come to this land."

Her eyes met the first continent, to the southwestern corner. "There will the seed of pain begin to fester," she thought.

*A pinch of a weeping soul, five petals of blood-soaked lavender, and two eyes of a madman.* And so, the curse was complete.

Oryllia took her final product, a molten sludge, and poured it over the continent's bottom corner. The soil twisted and blackened, barbed vines sprouted out of the ground to trouble any normal creature grazing there, and stone littered the rolling wastes, prevented any other kind of flora to blossom. Pools of black poison gather from the rainfall

# Fauna of the Wastes

Oryllia took the remainder of her cursed sludge, and crafted creatures cursed enough to weather the pains of the desolate landscape.

The **Blightbeast** is a large reptilian creature able to traverse the poisonous landscape of the Wastes, designed by the Witch-Queen herself. It can drink from the poison pools to sustain itself. They lay eggs in thickets of thorny vines to protect them from others, which hatch after 3 seasonal cycles.

The **Umbral Locust** is an insect that dwells within the Wastes, feasting upon the dead remnants of the thorned vines for sustenance. Along with a hivemind, these Locusts can spew a cloud of decaying mist that kills nearby flora.

# Recovery: Guiding the Tribes

Within the western reaches of the red plains, a small tribe had witnessed the Wastes of Pain and the horrific beasts that inhabited it. They shouted in fear and profanity to the skies, to the Witch who had plagued the land. Every three days, members of the tribe would offer a portion of their goods in fire on an altar, carved from stone to bear the five horns of the Witch-Queen.
