The mortals, noting that it was the shamans of Sunda had died, began asking a simple question: why?

The answer they came to was, perhaps, not the one Lyva had expected. She was upset that she was not being credited for her role in Sunda's creation.

So, with this knew knowledge in mind, the story changed somewhat, so it would reflect her contributions.

The previous story, of Lyva laying with many of the gods, remained largely unchanged, save for one small fact: it was now her idea.

Lyva, they said, was lonely. For all her possessions she lacked the greatest of gifts: a family. To this end Lyva lay with the gods, as the old story said, but now it was with the aim of creating herself a son.

No mere child would do for Lyva, who demanded only the best, and as such she challenged the gods of the world, declaring that only the greatest of them may sire her child.

Many of the features were attributed to the gods as *gifts* for Lyva, given to her in various attempts to win her favour.

In the end, the mortals said, Lyva lay with each of the gods, one by one, as the final test. Who the father was the mortals dared not speculate, for they didn't dare take the risk of angering another of the gods.
