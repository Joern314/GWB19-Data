Prismari has been visiting rictus as often as he could learning everything he could possibly learn about the iron law... and fishing yet he and rictus both never seemed to catch anything 

Kain had been invited several times but always refused until finally he suddenly accepted 

“Mr rictus.... I have someone who said they wanted to meet you.... but he said you likely won’t be happy to see him.” Prismari said well he fished 

About an hour later storm clouds grow over head and lightning stuck, a god with strawberry blonde hair was in front of him, they where old and in tatters but rictus could tell he wore the formal wear of the royalty of Nachtstadt. The god had his hands in the air 

“First off don’t kill me ! Second I’m sure my mother and father send there regards, are you planing to make the  Inquisitors ! “ kain said not moving a muscle and fully read to run away if rictus decided to kill him
