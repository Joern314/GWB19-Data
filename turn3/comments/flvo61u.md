"Urgh, Argh,  kekekekeke, that tickles! Gold is really conductive, stop it, my tails twitching right over a vill-ARGH!" Lyva giggled then roared at his antics as her tail slammed down a few kilometres away. "Whoops, I.. don't think I crushed anyone, luckily.... they're not screaming or anything... what?"    

Curious, the massive deity curled back over a couple of minutes until she found the poor stone huts around her golden tail, some humans wandering to and fro without concern.   

"PRISMARI! What's going on? Why aren't they praising me? Or screaming? Can I touch them?" She wondered, raising her tail in preparation to slam it down again.
