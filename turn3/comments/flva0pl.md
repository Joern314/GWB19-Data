*They were doing things again.    
Lyva's sleepy mind considered things. Within her... Leyana mumbled and called something.*        
"My lady, you are awake- the time has come, the worship has stabilised completely, you're in no danger of starving!"     
*Lyva wriggled, swimming deeper into the heat. "Five more minutes."*         
"My lady, that has been five minutes."    
*The draconic goddess rumbled and groaned, "Liar. That was seconds."*     
"Yes. Three hundred seconds. Five minutes." Leyana called, her abacus scales clinking against coins as she slithered through the perfectly organised hoard.     
*"Then give me another hour." Lyva yawned, laying her head down to-*     
"My lady that has been an hour."    
*"HOW WAS THAT AN HOUR?! It felt like nothing!"*     
"Respectfully my lady you are now around eight thousand years old. Proportionately, minutes and hours are nothing to one of your existence." Leyana suggested patiently, obediently as ever, "Therefore, I'd suggest moving at once to maximise the faith of the mortals in us to ensure you do not slumber for another millennium. I have been trying to wake you for eight hundred and fifty years."     
*Lyva wriggled in discontent. That old? How much would things have changed? And besides, "But it's cosy here........ oh now I get the silent treatment? But it's going to be cold outside and-"*    
"My lady, please. For the sake of the last eight hundred years, get out of bed and acquire more for your hoard! I've been counting the same items for the last eternity!" Leyana growled back, a note of stress in her normally silky voice. "Don't delay, don't think about it, just get up in three, two, o-"

The crust of the skull was broken, the skin ruptured as a massive blast of molten metal and power abruptly blasted out of the planets core. With it came a mountain of fire and burning metal, an ash cloud that spread out over the ocean to rain down, and a new volcanic island blistering and swelling over the waters. There was also, unseen to mortals, a colossal golden dragon looking sheepishly over the devastation, molten elements sloughing off her form to cool and dry like meteorites in the ocean.    
"You forgot you can teleport?" Leyana sighed.
"Oops." Lyva swallowed, then breathed, feeling her vast length stretch through the air, the sun gleam off her scales, the worship continue to pour into her heart. "It's fine, I can work with this."     

So saying she coiled down and around the volcanic island, calling up more and more crust and earth to expand and sculpt it. She drew the ash down to coat it and soften the harsh cliffs and summits with fertile soil, though in many places spires of cooled metal still remained like ancient spears. Tiers of hills rose up towards the central volcano, and a few smaller islands rose from the impact like stepping stones, forming a beautiful archipelago.     

Pleased with the scene, and eager to clean herself, Lyva flew up into space and shook off the remaining molten gold, shaping it into everburning meteors. She threw them out in a long line, the golden stars forming a great serpent, often seen above the **Kiln Islands**.
