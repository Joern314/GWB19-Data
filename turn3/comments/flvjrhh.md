While Malaphet, his eyes cold and unresponsive as he rested from the fighting that had taken place above the skies of the capital of the Empire of Blood slept, the bits of his essence that he had left hidden in the strange and dark places of the world during it's creation began to change and warp the world around them, especially on the islands that Malaphet pulled from the sea-bed to where they now stood.

On these islands life where it survived became strange, many taking after the divine being that had pulled the islands from the muck. From a glance most things might seem like a normal tropical island but at a longer look and you would notice things becoming strange, the creatures would often possess strange eyes or tentacles.

# Tadaloa Island Chain

The Tadaloan Island Chain is a large series of bountiful if not rather dreary cluster of mid to large sized tropical islands. In many cases during low tides it is possible to physically walk from one island to another without your feet ever getting wet, at least if you time it right, for the tides in the area would become known for a notoriously fickle and fast moving tidal actions due to the unique nature of the coast and sand bars in the area. The shoreline is not the only way to traverse the island, for underneath there is a deep and intricate cave system that runs through nearly every island in the chain, the only difficulty here is that the caves are confusing and difficult to track.

On most of the islands the plant life is thick, dense and low to the ground to help survive the wicked fierce storms that tend to buffet the area. This dense undergrowth has lead to a limiting in the size of most animal life, to compensate for this many animals have become much stronger then they should normally be for their size, perhaps due to the magical  field emitted by the divine essence that can be found on the island in small quantities.

Weird Animal: The **Thromboar**

The Thromboar is one of the only animals of the island chain to actively defy the general limitations on size imposed by the dense plantlife, instead preferring to trample through or devour the plantlife to get where it wants to go. The Thromboar looks like a severely oversized Boar save for a couple key differences such as it possessing a series of eight fully articulated and barbed tentacles sprouting from it's back, three pairs of eyes, and a thick muscular tail that enables it to be a powerful swimmer. From the tentacles oozes a dangerous toxin. In temperament the Thromboar is aggressive and like most other boars, is omnivorous, a few individuals actively preferring flesh to their regular diet of plants and fruits.
