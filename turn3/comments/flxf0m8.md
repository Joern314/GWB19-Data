The snake was metaphysical as well, invisible to mortal eyes. She no longer formed a ring around the sun, but now had an orbit at the far realms of the system, where the sun-eye was barely visible, almost as small as the other eyes of Malaphet.  

Her breathing was steady, but very slow, her lungs moving in periods of months, not the usual seconds.

She did not notice Lyva.

There were meteorites, sparsely flying around the same orbit as the snake. A fellow serpentine being, Lyva recognized them as partly being made from the shed skin of the other god. None of them were threatening to reach the planet, and collisions were rare enough to not realistically send them on a different course anytime soon.
