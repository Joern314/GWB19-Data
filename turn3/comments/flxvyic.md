"I am not Mr. Sorcerer. I am the Sorcerer. If you have to call me anything call me Sorcerer!" The Sorcerer complained over godspeak. "And what a question is this? I made the trees of course. Where else should they come from?" The Sorcerer said stepping out of the Rift and coming to stand in front of Kain. "Where is your puppy? Are you having it housebroken?" he asked sardonically looking around for Prismari. The young god irritated the Sorcerer with his naivety and so he was glad the boy god was not there.
